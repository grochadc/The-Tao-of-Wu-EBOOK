THIRD PILLAR OF WISDOM
CHAMBERS
Knowing others is wisdom.
Knowing yourself is Enlightenment.
-Lao-tzu
I 've been a story reader since I was three, a storyteller almost as long. When I was ten, I was friends with a ‘•Milanese Muslim kid named Cassim, who knew a lot of tilt* same Bible stories I did, since people like Job and Abraham are also mentioned in the Koran. The two of MS would post up in the hood, telling tales of the prophets to other kids. That’s what the Bible was to me back then - stories — until I found Knowledge, and the truth to them became real.
For years, it was the same way with kung-fu flicks. From the first time I saw *The Five Deadly Venoms*, in 1978, I was hooked — hooked on the fighting, the period, the 52 locales, and the stories. But the truth of those stories didn't hit me for a few years. Then, one day in 1983, when I was almost fourteen, I was watching TV. The screen flashed a commercial for next week’s movie: On June 6 The Thirty-sixth Chamber of Shaolin .” That was some prophetic numerology — 6, 6, 36 — and the movie had just that kind of impact on me. It was like something from the Old Testament or a Greek epic. It changed my life, for real, because its wisdom brought my own story alive.
The Shaw Brothers made the movie in 1978, but its about a man in the eighteenth century who becomes a Shaolin monk. The man, San Te, starts out as a college student learning ethics. When he hears about the revolution against the Manchus, who are oppressing the native people, he joins the revolution and becomes a messenger. He gets wounded in a Manchu attack and seeks refuge from the monks of the Shaolin temple. At first, they reject him because he’s an ignorant outsider, but then the abbot there sees something in him. He begins training him in martial arts.
San Te starts out the film knowing nothing. By the end, he’s a master. He completes all thirty-five chambers of Shaolin training faster than any other student finishing them in seven years. Then he wants to start a thirty-sixth chamber to teach the wisdom of Shaolin to the world. I was fourteen years old when I saw that film. I had Knowledge of Self, had mastered the 120 faster than anyone my  age, and was teaching Mathematics to others. When I saw The Thirty-sixth Chamber, I felt like I was living it.
The story is about oppression and transformation. The Manchus are oppressors; the students are the oppressed. But it takes the older monks to show them they’re oppressed — they thought things were always like that. As a Mathematician, I could relate to that on a variety of levels — the students’ blindness, the teachers’ wisdom, the reality of the oppression, and the strength it would take to overcome it.
The second part of the movie is about the kung-fu training San Te goes through, and that really inspired me — started me doing push-ups, punching walls, going to Chinatown to buy kung-fu books. But it also confirmed the path I was already on. It was like an echo of the Lessons from another world, a reflection that made my situation clear.
As we say, Wisdom is a reflection of Knowledge. And when I was a kid, the only knowledge the media showed about black history was about either slaves or pimps Roots, The Mack, and that was basically it. So in a way, films like The Thirty-sixth Chamber reflected our experience and solidified it, drew people like me into the truth of our own history. And after that, martial arts films became serious to me. I studied them like lessons.
I still do. Even today, if you come to my house you’ll see I got a lot of movies there, but about a thousand of them are kung-fu movies. They run from Bruce Lee classics like The Chinese Connection, to a John Liu joint 54 like Secret Rivals, to The Hot, the Cool and the Vicious, which is almost like a Western, to Martial Arts of Shaolin, which is one of Jet Li’s first films. Today, I watch them for inspiration — to see the hardships Jet Li’s character overcomes in Hero or Fearless, or the trials the family endures in Curse of the Golden Flower. I look for signals in my own life, to see how they activate those responses. These films still work that way for me: kung fu, samurai, even anime films — they still act like a mirror.
Take even a cartoon like Dragon Ball Z. I mean, it’s a cartoon, but it’s one of the deepest cartoons in history. Its hero, Son Goku, starts out as a kid, begins martial arts training like San Te, and goes off on a quest for seven balls that unleash dragons that can grant wishes. Now, that’s a fantasy, obviously, a children’s story. But it’s also based on a sixteenth-century Chinese folk novel, about a Buddhist monk who travels to India to find the Buddhist sutras. That voyage represents a journey to enlightenment. But to me, Dragon Ball Z also represents the journey of the black man in America.
You see it more clearly as the story goes on. You learn that Son Goku is part of an ancient race called the Saiyans, who come from a distant planet and were known as the fiercest warriors in the galaxy. So Son Goku has superpowers but doesn’t realize it — a head injury destroyed his memory, robbed his knowledge of self. Then one day, he gets stressed beyond his limits and Hulks out into his alter ego, Super Saiyan — a nigga with dreadlocks. (Get it?)
This kind of story comes up in world literature, even in the Bible: Abraham is told his seed will be lost for four hundred years, in a land not their own, not knowing who they are or where they’re from. That’s the story of the Jewish people, but it’s also the story of the black man in America.
So I say we are the Saiyans; I even use the name Goku as a tag when I write. And when my hair is in an Afro? Word up: I’m Super Saiyan.
By the time I was seventeen, I was going to kung-fu flicks all the time — skipping school, staying out late, hitting the twenty-four-hour movie spots on Forty-second Street, where they showed only porno and kung fu. But then, in 1986, I saw another film that hit me almost as hard as Thirty-sixth Chamber. And this one would change many more lives than just my own.
It was a cold night, and Dirty and I were doing like we always did — running around, getting drunk, starting fights, chasing girls. Then finally, around four a.m., we started looking for somewhere warm to crash out with our 40s. We wound up at this funky little porno theater on Forty-second Street and Seventh Avenue, one with a back chamber the size of a classroom, where they showed kung-fu flicks and bums came to sleep. That’s what we were about to do, but as we walked in — cold, drunk, and tired — I caught the tail end of a movie that woke me right the fuck up. It ended, another movie started, and I waited up all through that second feature to see the first one again from the beginning. It was called Shaolin and Wu-Tang, and I didn’t sleep that night.
At that point, I’d have to say this was the best kung-fu movie I’d ever seen. The sword fighting alone was from another planet. Then there was the attitude of the Wu- Tang themselves. The Wu-Tang were defectors from the Shaolin temple, warriors who had trained at Shaolin then developed a sword style that was invincible. In a lot of kung-fu films — like Fist of the White Lotus or even Kill Bill — the Wu-Tang are actually the bad guys. And at one point in Shaolin and Wu-Tang, this one Wu-Tang dude defeats thirty Shaolin monks and gets expelled from the temple. Before he goes through, he says: “I may be expelled, but I’m still the best . . . Wu- Tang!” Even though he’s kicked out of the temple, he’s still the baddest motherfucker out there.
That kind of attitude catches on fast in the hood, and pretty soon a lot of Stapleton niggas were onto the Wu-Tang. Then the word was popping up in slang. The first person to use it was Ghost. He’d say “that Wu shit,” meaning “that fly shit.” He called Old English “Wu juice.” But since I was more attuned to the martial arts movies and history, I was able to elaborate. I decided that I didn’t drink Wu juice — because I drank Ballantine Ale — I drank Shaolin. Then I coined the term “Wu-Tang slang,”  and everybody started speaking it — just as a way to relate to one another.
So before it was a rap group or even a hip-hop crew, Wu-Tang was just a bunch of hustlers living in the hood, guys who loved MCing and hip-hop and connected at a tiny house to make music. A lot of us were in street business to survive, some of us were even enemies. But a love of both hip-hop and the world of knowledge brought us together, and before long we became a brotherhood. To me, that last part came into focus with one final kung-fu film I showed them in 1989, a film that solidified the common love between us.
I had actually seen it years before, with my family. The movie is Eight-Diagram Pole Fighter, and it tells a story of a large family that gets betrayed by a general, goes to war, and loses nearly every member to violence. There are eight brothers and three sisters in the film, and I have eight brothers and three sisters in my family. So, in my crib, we all used to watch that together — saw it over and over and over. But a few years later, when I showed it to my friends, it took on a wider, deeper meaning.
By 1989, everyone at the projects was into kung-fu films, and a lot of us had VCRs. So one day, when a bunch of dudes came over to my crib to get high and watch flicks, I pulled out a tape of Eight-Diagram. Before we were an hour into it, something strange happened in that crib. People got real quiet, some niggas even started crying. Because that movie is real — it’s a reflection of the reality we were all living.
A general betrays a family, A father gets killed. All his sons are killed except for two. One goes crazy. The other shaves his head, becomes a monk. You see this kind of thing happening in the hood every day. We were living in a place torn apart by wars — neighborhood against neighborhood, dealer against dealer — a place where you see people get killed or go crazy every week, a place where the bonds you make are almost stronger than blood. When someone has your back in a situation like that, it’s a life-or-death thing — a real brotherhood.
I know that Ghostface, Dirty, and GZA all understood the deeper implication these movies had for our lives, and I know everyone in the Clan does now. From Thirty-sixth Chamber you get discipline and struggle. From Shaolin and Wu-Tang you get the warrior technique — plus the idea bad guys are sometimes the illest. Then, from Eight-Diagram Pole Fighter, you get the brotherhood, the soul. You get the idea that. This guy right here? He’s stronger than me. Maybe he can take it a little further than I can. Let me throw my power behind him so we all rise up.
In a way, the group we’d end up forming had to be called the Wu-Tang Clan. The name says that we’re Wu- Tang warriors, we’re from Shaolin, and we’re a Clan, which means family. That last part’s just as crucial because it’s about a connection to something bigger than yourself, which is where the greatest strength always comes from.  That last bit of wisdom started to take hold of me later, when I began studying with Sifu Shi Yan Ming, a thirty-fourth generation Shaolin monk who defected from China in ’92 and came to open a Shaolin temple in New York. He was the abbot of his school, I was the abbot of mine — he felt like a peer. But I also wanted to learn from him. “Sifu” can translate as “master,” and that’s a tough word in the black community, but I realized that sometimes you have to submit to someone to learn. So I did.
With Sifu I learned many Shaolin techniques, but my favorite is probably the Five Elements, maybe because I saw The Five Deadly Venoms at a young age. This technique breaks nature down into five basic forces: earth, water, metal, wood, and fire — which are also represented by the kung-fu styles snake, crane, dragon, leopard, and tiger. Most martial arts teach you to be as fluid as water, but earth absorbs water — so you counter water techniques with earth techniques, which absorb blows. Then if someone comes at you with earth techniques, you counter with wood styles, which drive forward. Then you counter wood with metal styles, which chop like an axe, and metal with fire styles, which are more explosive, and, finally, you fight fire with water.
These principles are both external and internal. Internally, it applies to your five major organs. Earth is the spleen, metal is the lungs, water is the kidneys, wood is the liver, fire is the heart. Like, I have asthma, so the form I learned to combat it with was metal — to strengthen my lungs. At the same time, if you have a problem with your lungs, since fire melts metal you think of the energy from your heart pouring into your lungs. If your heart is aching emotionally, you think of the water from your kidney coming to quench your heart. You do all this mentally — it’s inner Taoism.
Studying with Sifu, I learned that kung fu was less a fighting style and more about the cultivation of the spirit. What made a Shaolin monk so tough was his mastery of chi — the fact he could make contact with the Earth and draw the energy from it through him. He’s using his body, his breath, and his mind to align himself with the Tao — which is pure energy, the energy that sprang from a primal stillness called wu-chi. Tai chi translates as “the grand extreme” and breaks all ideas, forces, and objects into opposites, yin and yang. But wu-chi, which translates as “no extremes,” came before tai chi. It’s infinite, the source of all power, and it’s all one.
A lot of people in our culture see life in terms of opposites — like, good versus evil, me versus you, valuable versus worthless, black versus white. Taoists believe you have to see beyond these to find their essential union. When Wu-Tang Clan started out, we had the saying “Tang is the slang, Wu is the way.” I didn’t know the tai chi meaning of it then, but it turns out I was on the money. In a way, Wu-Tang pointed me to a wisdom that unified Mathematics and Taoism, that showed me their essential harmony.  Islam is not a religion. It’s a way of life in touch with the universe. It’s the same as the Tao, which means the Way — it’s the way of the universe. The only differences between Taoism and Islam are the more esoteric ideas and traditions that developed around them. True Taoists don’t talk about different gods. True Buddhists don’t teach var- ious deities. And the basic principle is really the same for Taoism, Buddhism, and Mathematics — to be one with the universe, one with God. They are all the Way.
I think we’re all trying to get to one destination — unifying with God. We’re all striving to do that here on earth. So when Jesus says, through me you can find the kingdom of heaven, to me, that means he was in tune with God. If you follow his example, you’ll find the kingdom of God on earth. We all have natural things in us that prevent us and that help us. We all have evil nature in us — lying, stealing, killing — and we fight against it. The Ten Commandments aren’t commandments that you need to read. They’re inside you. Islam, Taosim, the teachings of the Bible — they’re all ways to get in touch with God’s truth within you. And for a lot of people, this takes work.
Look at it this way. In kung-fu training, chambers are the stages of learning you must pass through. But as Mathematicians, we conceive of each chamber as having ten degrees — like the ten degrees in the Lessons. So within each chamber, you go from 1, which represents Knowledge, to 9, which represents Born, like the nine months it takes to bear a child. But then, when you go past Born— from 9 to 10— you're actually going back to 1, or Knowledge, because 10 is 1 with a circle beside it.
This kind of thing takes years of meditation to understand, but it’s right there beneath the surface, represented in signs and numbers. An enlightened man sees that there actually are no numbers. It’s all a circle. On a number line, the numbers left of zero head off to negative infinity and the ones right of zero head off to positive infinity. But it's infinity either way. The number line goes in both directions, endlessly, all within that one cycle or chamber. It’s the same thing as yin and yang — with a drop of yin there s always a speck of yang — but they all go back to 1.
Today, some brothers get mad at me saying things like this. They say, “Why you fuckin’ with Chinese dudes? How come you talk to Caucasian motherfuckers like they’re brothers?” I know how they feel. And I bear witness that Allah is one, the Father of the black man, who must take his proper place as God of himself. But over the years, I came to believe the basic lesson of Mathematics is the same as that of Taoism, Buddhism, and every great spiritual path. It’s that we all have the potential to become like God.
Even Son Goku eventually learns how to develop chi on his own, to become Super Saiyan at will. And today, I believe we’ve all got a Saiyan inside us, because God is in each of us. That’s what we’re all trying to reach, through all the chambers of our lives.
If you reach the thirty-sixth chamber, you have completed your learning. You have multiplied one chamber by 36 and gotten 360 degrees — a completed circle. If you add 3 to 6 you get 9 — which represents Born — but then you must add one more to 9, and Born becomes Knowledge again. And this puts you right back into the circle, back at 1.
From Knowledge to Born, then Born, back to Knowledge — it always returns to the beginning, to 1. And right there, that maybe the most important lesson you can get. It’s Mathematics, baby: We’re all one.
But in this world, that kind of thing can take decades to see clearly. Not everyone has that much time, or those opportunities. An ancient Taoist named Ho Shang Rung once wrote, “A dragon is still, thus it can constantly transform itself. A tiger is busy, thus it dies young.” And in my life, the tigers would outnumber the dragons ten to one.
