HOLY WARRIORS
A STREET PARABLE OF FAITH
Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is that I felt the touch of God. God got involved.
— Jules Winnifield, Pulp Fiction
In 1986, New York City hip-hop was a war. As a man is becoming a samurai, he roams the country in search of opponents. And as an MC, you did the same thing — traveling to different neighborhoods to find battles. Hip-hop at that time was righteous and violent. MCs were bombing Mathematics and murdering foes. I was seventeen years old and just that kind of walking contradiction.
I used to ride the subway with a huge, Big Daddy Kane-style gold cable around my neck, my book of 120 lessons, and a .38 revolver tucked into a slot inside. The gun and the 120 — it’s like the Bible and the six-shooter in a Western, or the sword in a Muslim flag. Human beings have lived with that contradiction for centuries, but Americans always found their own expression of it. And at that time hip-hop gave me a crucial lesson in metaphors and reality, expression and truth.
One night, four buddies and I were at a block party in Manhattan’s Lower East Side — five young Muslims, five young street thugs. I was an MC representing All In Together Now Crew, which included GZA and ODB, and we had a mix tape out in the streets by the same name. In a year, I’d put out a record with Tommy Boy as Prince Rakeem — on some smooth, charming-the-ladiesman shit — but for now I was about warfare. The party was in a street park with a baseball field nearby — no stage, just turntables and some equipment. Some other MCs were taking turns, so I jumped right in, rapping “I’m a bum you, nigga . . .” — and I did. I burned ’em up. Then I challenged the DJ on turntables and put work on him as well.
This was a big, loud party, and everyone was Spanish — we were the only black motherfuckers there. So after I burned these MCs down, this one dude got jealous and pulled out a gun. He started talking shit about how he’s the nicest nigga there and fires into the air — ham! bam! ham! ham! bam ! ham ! — just to help make his point.
You could say that this act made the battle literal. But we didn’t care. We were taking mescaline, drinking beer, and protected by Allah — invincible. So I started talk ing shit right back. I held up a bag I was carrying and started laughing — saying, “Nigga, that ain’t shit. Don'l let me go in the bag, nigga! Yo, I got the biggest Tec in the world, nigga!..."
In hip-hop and in the streets, a boast is a projection of strength — a threat that is itself an action. Labor union, act by threatening to strike. Rappers act by threatening to destroy. In fact, whole careers have been based on pure projection. That was definitely the case here be cause, in reality, that bag didn’t have anything in it hut my lessons and a screwdriver. Even so, my projection backed that dude down. He started saying, “Nah, n.ili, nah — we cool, homie!” We backed him down with tin force of the word.
That was one lesson we should have learned and left with. Instead, God was going to teach us another.
We were pumped up by this victory and ended up walking back to the projects — stopping in bodegas, steal ing beer, taking whatever we wanted. We must have terrorized this neighborhood for about two hours — talking to girls, ripping off delis, five cowboys with nothing behind us but this bag.
Then, after about two hours of doing this, I felt like, “Okay, we’re overdoing it.” But my man Asaham, who was my student in Islam, wouldn’t stop. “Yo, look at those two shorties over there,” he said. “Let me go holler at them real quick.” He went over and started talking to these girls.
Meanwhile, the bodega people we’d terrorized had been talking to each other. The other dudes from the party were coming back. People were converging around us. But my man was still talking to these two girls. Finally, two guys came walking over to him as we were standing on the side, waiting for him to get their phone numbers. My man yelled to me, "Yo, Ra! These niggas talking shit!” So I had to come over and puff myself up and try my old routine: “Don’t let me go to the bag, nigga!”
This time, a little Spanish dude came up, acting all apologetic: “No, no, no, Papi, we don’t want no trouble, Papi, we don’t want no trouble” and — BAM ! — punched tin in the face. My hat flew off. It was on. In less than thirty seconds, my man Asaham was on the ground, his shoulder broken, and the rest of us were fighting for our lives. As the crowd closed in on us, I tried to front a little bit with the bag — “What, what, what” — but they had real guns out. We’d given them a full two hours to go home and get them.
This was hubris — an overdose of pride, the fatal flaw dull gets heroes in Greek epics killed. Which is almost what happened to us. We ran. They started shooting at us.
I promise you, unless you’ve done it, you don’t know what it's like when you hit that corner and hear the fence go ping! ping! ping! and see those sparks fly behind you.
Somehow we got away and ended up on some block, mil of breath, and realized that one of us, Asaham, was missing. We had to go back for him.
I told my youngest cousin, Richie, to go home, and the three others of us picked up bottles and rocks and started walking back to get Asaham.
As soon as we hit the corner, the mob was right there — at a full run, coming after us. This is when I actually felt that God, and not my own self-projection, saved my life.
I took off my hat and froze. Everybody in that mob ran right by me. None of them saw me, even though I was right in front of them. My friends had left, and I stood there alone and frozen as at least fifteen people ran by. When the last two in the crowd passed, one stopped and looked at me. He said, “Isn’t that one of them?” “Nah, nah, nah,” the other one said. They ran on. And I took off in the opposite direction.
Three of us made it home that night, with busted heads and broken bones. One of us, Kedar, didn’t. He got stabbed thirteen times and spent three weeks in the hospital. This man was a champion fighter, one of the toughest motherfuckers ever — a knockout master. He came out in a wheelchair and started walking a year later. He was never the same. It could have been any of us.
I have to give all praises due, because I believe that night, just for a minute, Allah made me invisible. When we held those niggas down for hours with just a screwdriver and the Lessons, that wasn’t a miracle. That was a trick. I believe in Jedi mind tricks because I’ve used them many times. But my invisibility? By taking off my hat and really believing to myself that they didn’t see me? That was faith — a desperate faith, a true faith.
When the Meccans were trying to kill Muhammad, he hid in a cave. When his would-be assassins found it, they saw a spiderweb hanging across the entrance, so they didn’t go in — they figured no one had broken the web so no one was there.
Scientists have said that a spiderweb, structurally, is stronger than steel. The strongest bulletproof vest you can make is essentially spiderwebs woven together. You measure a molecule of steel versus a molecule of spiderweb, the spiderweb is stronger. I put that in a lyric: “A spiderweb is known to be stronger than steel / Trapped in a cave, Muhammad used it as his only shield.” In that moment, my spiderweb was my cloak of invisibility. It was my belief, my faith. It would save my life again.
