ABOVE THE RUCKUS


A GUIDE TO KNOWLEDGE OF SELF

M

Fast for a few days. Don’t have a lot of people around. Be
alone and quiet. You’ll start to hear yourself, feel yourself.
You’ll hear from the you that’s not the you your family,
society, or history created. You’ll hear from the you that’s
beneath that, the one that’s always there with you — the
you that contains the God particle.

Take time. This country fills up every second of your
day with noise. That’s why they call this place Babylon —
the Great Harlot, the Great Deceiver. Because it keeps us
away from our true selves. So do the one thing this cul-
ture tries hard not to let you do: Look inside yourself.

Be by yourself. Yell out asking God for help until you’re
almost crying. Let all those chemicals inside you come
rushing up to your brain and ask for whatever you’re look-
ing for. This is prayer — it’s opening your heart.

Martial arts are a form of prayer — they’re why Da’Mo
taught the monks kung fu. The monks were getting tired
and sleepy and couldn’t pray properly, so Da’Mo taught


them certain postures to strengthen their bodies. Saint
goes with the Muslims. They weren’t in shape, their diet
was bad— they weren’t in good condition to pray. So
the Prophet taught them how to do Salaat, the Island,
prayer rituals that are basically martial arts. (In fact, one
long form actually looks like the kung-fb style SIeepin K
Lo-Han.)

Find a form of prayer and do it — to enhance your life,
build up your chi, to attract positivity. Studying lessons
and reading great religious books is an excellent form ol
prayer. But whichever you choose, don’t pray to have
something pop up under your Christmas tree. Pray to pul
yourself in harmony with God. Do that and your prayers
will be answered.





What we learn to do
we learn by doing-

— Aristotle


n April of 1991, 1 got back to New York on a mission.
At my trial, my moms inspired me to walk the right
path, and I did— literally. In Staten Island, 1 walked every
day for hours. I mean, walked , like Da Mo walked all the
way from India to China. I’d walk from the Park Hill
projects to the Staten Island ferry dock, from New Brigh-
ton to the Stapleton projects, walking through May, June,
July. Some people thought 1 was crazy because they’d see
me out there walking and talking to myself. Later, I told
one of them, “I may have been talking, but I wasn’t talk-
ing to myself.”

Those walks were a form of meditation, which any

wisdom seeker should practice. You can meditate in the
lotus position — the “royal seat” or the “royal crown” po-
sition, as it’s called — or you can meditate just walking
down the block. You don’t have to be still; your eyes don’t
have to be closed. Meditation just means you are aware
of your inner self as well as your outer self. Watch your-
self, because nobody else is gonna watch you but you.

Like most meditation, those walks on Staten Island
didn’t create something; they revealed something —
something that was already floating over the island, ready
to take form. I found that what I wanted to do, could do,
and should do was form a record company, collect the
best MCs I knew, and become the kind of rap group that
no one had ever imagined.

Meditation allowed me to see what we already were in
a new light. It brought me Wisdom — which is light. It
illuminated how these seemingly unrelated areas of
knowledge connected to one another. For example, I’d
been reading the Bible for years. When it says that Peter
cut the guy’s ear off in the garden, I figured that Peter had
to be a martial artist. To cut a guy’s ear off with a slice that
precise you gotta be nice. That’s on a physical level. But
on a mental level, his words were that nice. He must have
said something that wrecked this guy with his knowl-
edge- That kind of knowledge could work in hip-hop.

The knowledge was latent — the Wu-Tang movie, the
Bible stories, the kung-fu epics, hip-hop battles — but
meditation allowed me to connect them all, to see their


possibilities and apply them to my life. Knowledge is
I nowing, wisdom is doing. And I realized that nobody
i I n- could do that at the time, because nobody had that
I 'articular group of experiences, knowledge, and homies.
til been making tapes with these dudes for years. Even
when I had a deal as Prince Rakeem, Park Hill niggas like
Meth, Deck, Raekwon, and U-God would come over to
my crib, and I’d produce them. But meditations on Staten
Island revealed what was there the whole time: the illest
MG team in history.

When Da’Mo was meditating for nine years, his future
■aif came back and talked to his current self. His current
self said, “Who are you?” his future self says, “I’m you.”
And Da’Mo says, “What do you mean?” His future self
says, “I’m what you’re going to become.” Da’Mo had at-
tained a state in which he could see that time is linear but
life is eternal. So there’s really no beginning, no ending,
linear logic measures only the four dimensions: length,
width, depth, and time. But in the fifth dimension, energy
surpasses time. Light surpasses time. Time is just a con-
troller of certain planes. It’s not the master.

The true master is consciousness, and I mean true con-
sciousness — not simply being awake — I’m talking about
the consciousness that never sleeps. The part of you that
is aware of your consciousness. There’s a part of you that’s
always there, always consistent, that represents your true
self — the part connected to God. That’s who you gotta get
in touch with.

In my case, I wouldn’t say I had that mythic dimen-
sion that Da’Mo had, but I definitely had those moments
of seeing ahead. I was blessed with that sight. To this day,
I feel that’s what gave me the vision that drove me
through that year — what removed obstacles, guided ac-
tions, and brought us all together.

It was’t easy. I moved to 134 Morningstar Road in
Staten Island, a two-bedroom place I shared with my girl-
friend, our daughter, Ghost, my brother Divine, my
brother Born, and my sister Sherri. It was the first address
for Wu-Tang Productions. My girlfriend, my daughter,
and I slept on the floor on a boxing-gym mat. There I felt
a force larger than me, larger than any of us, that was
calling our group into being.

You could feel it in our first talk about forming a
crew — a talk that saved Method Man’s life. I was talking
with Rae about the idea outside a building called 160 —
160 Park Hill Avenue, the building in our first video, for
“Protect Ya Neck.” It was our hangout spot and the drug
spot, a center of life and death. I was across the street
from 1 60 talking with Rae, Deck, and a few other homies
about forming a crew called the Wu-Tang Clan. Then I
saw Method Man coming down the sidewalk.

I yelled over to him, “Yo, Shaquan” — then he was
known as Shaquan — “Shaquan! Come over here, yo!”He
was on his way into 160 to score some weed. But when
he heard me, he stopped and came running over. A few
seconds later — pow-pow-pow-pow-pow ! — a guy started


*, I looting up the front of 160. A buddy of ours. Poppy, an
Innocent, school-going, nice guy — he was shot andkilled
l ight there. The guys who shot him were Brooklyn niggas
beefing with Staten Island niggas — they were gunning
lor Meth. Meth later told me, “Yo, you saved my life that
day, because I was headed right into the doorway that got
shot up.”

There was a kind of fate, this kind of universal mo-
mentum behind us then, and it helped me do something
no one else had done — unite eight talented, unique, indi-
vidual MCs as one.

At first the Clan was just me and Ghost, though every-
one else was down with Wu-Tang crew and Wu-Tang slang,
but it was more like a street gang than a group. I’d signed
most of them to my production company. Dirty and my
GZA were my cousins so they were down. Method Man
and Deck signed as my two main artists. But this time, at
Morningstar Road, I called all the brothers together. I said
lhat we were going to go out as Wu-Tang Clan.

I had the contracts ready. I said give me five years and
I will take us to number one. It was a long conversation,
eye-to-eye, man-to-man. I said that no one could ques-
tion my authority. It had to be a dictatorship. I didn’t say
I was the toughest nigga in the crew, but with what I had
in mind, I had to be the so-called leader because I was the
best knower. The best leader is somebody who’s able to
serve. If you’re truly able to serve, you’re able to lead. I
think the other members of the Clan could see that in me.

I was a bit older than some of them. I was known to be a
good knower — the youngest to master the 120 — and they
always looked at me as an intelligent guy in the neighbor-
hood who never crossed any of them. In a way, I led by
example. Even when I was involved with negativity, I
think they could see that I never did it with a negative
heart. I did it out of desperation.

Everyone agreed and everyone signed the contract. In
October of 1992, we recorded the single of “Protect Ya
Neck” and started selling out of the trunk of my cousin
Mook’s Mercury Scorpio — no record deal, no support. It
wasn’t until December or January that New York’s WBLS
played it, on Kid Capri’s show. Most of us were all on
Morningstar Road, packing records up and listening to
BLS, when it came for the first time. Raekwon jumped so
high into the air — and he’s short — that his head almost
hit the ceiling. I’ll never forget that moment. Our record
was on the fucking radio.

After that happened, I started taking meetings, trying
to get deals. It was time to enter the music business for
real. And I gotta say, when I came, I came in war. I did not
come in peace. I came in with the Wu-Tang sword and my
own army — but it was an army that I loved.

As hip-hop kept growing as a movement, a lot of
people became successful because they started forming
alliances with other celebrities — now, you’ll see a song
with five or six celebrities all from the South, but with
individual careers. But they weren’t childhood friends.


Wc were all childhood friends. We were a clan, for real.
And this shaped our business dealings. There’s a Chinese
proverb that says, “When planning for a year, plant com.
When planning for a decade, plant trees. When planning
for life, train and educate people.” I felt we were plan-
ning for life.

By March of ’93, “Protect Ya Neck” had sold over ten
thousand singles. That got our names on the radar of
some record execs, one of them being Steve Rifkind, head
of Loud Records. Rifkind offered Wu-Tang a single deal
with an album option. While there were other labels that
wanted to sign us — some offering as much as $200,000 —
most of them wanted to sign the group as a whole, in-
cluding any solo efforts. But I knew that a sum like two
hundred grand wouldn’t be enough money to support us
and keep us going on the long-term plan I had for us. So
instead we signed with Rifkind for a fraction of the
money, but with the freedom to solicit ourselves to other
labels and make solo deals.

After signing with Loud, we decided to replace the
song “After the Laughter Comes Tears” from the B-Side of
“Protect Ya Neck” with the single “Method Man.” We re-
recorded “Method Man,” improved the quality, and put it
out. That single took off — by April, thirty thousand copies
had been sold, becoming Rifkind’s biggest single so far. As
the Abbot, I felt it was wisest for the Clan to invest in
Method Man as a solo artist — a decision the Clan agreed
with — knowing that the song would be huge enough to

make Method Man a star. In fact, that became my primary
objective: to systematically launch each member as a solo
star by giving them exposure through the Wu-Tang
Clan — a crucial part of my five-year plan.

The success of “Method Man” and the buzz around
Wu-Tang caused other labels to come checking for us.
One of them was Def Jam, the label every rapper wanted
to be signed to — the epitome of hip-hop on the East
Coast. Naturally, we were excited when Def Jam’s A&R
rep, Tracy Waples, came out to Morningside Road, lis-
tened to our music, went back and told Russell Simmons
about us. In fact, Simmons wanted to sign both Method
Man and Dirty. But I didn’t want to put both artists on
the same label. My idea was to spread it out and I had
recently called Elektra Records and spoken to the A&R
rep Dante Ross, who was in love with ODB. So Method
Man went to Def Jam, ODB — unwillingly — went to
Elektra, and the Wu-Tang sound began to be dispersed
throughout the industry.

We finished the Wu-Tang Clan album Enter the Wu-
Tang 36 Chambers. It came out in November 1993 and
sold thirty thousand units in its first week It cost exactly
$36,000 to make. Of course it did. It was our thirty-sixth
chamber. After all those years of being confined to Staten
Island, developing talent, going through the training of
the chambers, this was our moment to share our wisdom
with the world. That’s why we chose the name Wu-Tang
instead of Shaolin. Shaolin is a holy place — there’s no


violence or crime in Shaolin. Wu-Tang are the people
who studied at Shaolin and left. Some of them joined the
government, some became killers, others bandits; in
some movies they’re good guys, but mostly they’re bad.
1 1 bought we were the bad guys but that we were bringing
this Shaolin chamber to the world. That’s why I named
Staten Island Shaolin. While Shaolin stayed on Staten
Island, Wu-Tang went out into the world.


Wu-Tang Clan truly did take a martial arts approach to
hip-hop — to the sound of the music, the style of the lyr-
ics, the competitive wordplay of the rhyming, the mental
preparations involved. I think we really did bring a new
school to the world. But for one of us, the study in Shao-
lin wasn’t complete. I was still in the temple, still in my
final chambers of hip-hop production.

I’d been there for years, making my own beats since
around ’82. Me and my big brother Divine were hip-hop
fiends and, in a way, electronic geeks as well. We always
had our own turntables, our own echo box, our own mi-
crophones, our own four-track recorders. For me, it came
from a burning passion to make my own songs.

In ’82, 1 started out with a straight-arm Technics SL-6
turntable. By ’85, 1 had a Roland 606 drum machine, then
a 707. By ’88, 1 got my first sampler, a little Casio toy that
sampled only two seconds of sound at a time. I was always
scrambling for new gear — borrowing, stealing — but I

didn’t do it out of love of technology. 1 did it out of love
of hip-hop. I was the guy who used to break-dance, DJ,
write graffiti, MC — do anything to do with hip-hop.
That’s probably one of the reasons the title abbot stuck
with me. Because I was a student of all forms.

At certain points in your education, it’s good to be
focused, to be a purist. In a way, that’s what I was, a hip-
hop purist, but a purist of hip-hop in its entirety. Back
then not all hip-hop producers, certainly not the most
famous, were that deeply into all aspects of hip-hop cul-
ture. You look at someone like Heavy D — he’s a great,
platinum-selling artist, but his beats sound more like
booty-shaking music. Afrika Bambaataa, he’s a founder
of hip-hop and deserves supreme respect, but he and his
crew dressed like George Clinton, and their music was
funkier and more dance-oriented. But I felt there was an
actual sound to hip-hop culture then, a spirit that existed
on its own plane, in the streets and parks, in the air. I
wanted to be a vessel for that sound.

Me and my crew were strictly hip-hop. I hated any-
thing else. I made beats to rhyme to, not to make a party
jump. You look at Rob Base, “It Takes Two,” that was a
number-one record, but he wasn’t a good MC, and no
good MC ever made a good song with that beat. On the
other hand, KRS-One was an MC. His beats weren’t club-
rocking beats; it was his lyrics that made the club rock. Or
look at Eric B. and Rakim. Their song “Eric B. Is Presi-
dent” was a dub rocker, but the song that made everyone


i cnlly notice Rakim as an MC was “My Melody.” On the
radio you heard, “I came in the door, I said it before . . .”
from “Eric B. Is President.” On the streets you heard, “I
take seven MCs, put ’em in the line . . .” from “My Mel-
ody.” That was the actual sound of hip-hop.

That’s what I strove to make: street music, beats that
MCs could rap on, beats that would make you wanna rip
a hole out of the wall. I was focused. But it took a while
for people to catch on to what I was trying to do, and for
me to realize that a true artist is a craftsman, someone
who knows the art from the bottom up.

When I was MCing as Prince Rakeem, my manager
would take me to all these different producers to make
songs. I’d got all over New York — the Bronx, Harlem,
Manhattan— listen to fifty beats before I found one I
wanted to rhyme to. Finally, I told him, “Can you buy me
a beat machine and let me make the beats?” He said, “Nah.”
He thought my beats were weird; he didn’t think I had it.

After I got kicked out of the Stapleton projects,
I wound up in an apartment at 7 Purroy Place, up-
stairs from my aunt, right around the corner from my
grandmother’s place on Targee. This was a starving- artist
situation. I had to plug my equipment into my aunt’s
downstairs apartment through a long extension cord so
I could have electricity for lights and making beats. But
Meth and I recorded the song “Method Man” there. I
made the beat for “Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthin’ to Fuck
With” there. All of it was done with stolen electricity,

m on a little eight-track, an Emulator X SP1200 sampler,
112 and an Ensoniq EPS 16 Plus sampling keyboard that
I got from hustling. It was the true hip-hop means of
production.

After that, we moved to Morningstar Road, to a two-
bedroom shared by seven people, where we made the
beat and most of the song for “C.R.E.A.M.” Then, when
we started making money off our first singles, I moved
my girl and baby to a two-bedroom in Michelle Court,
in Staten Island’s Mariners Harbor. That’s where I feel I
completed my training in hip-hop production — where I
truly mastered the craft.

The music on 36 Chambers is an accumulation of
beats from the Stapleton projects, Purroy, and Morning-
star Road. But at Michelle Court, I found something I
never had in my life: a basement. 1 put studio equipment
down there, and from that moment I was down there all
day, every day. I made beats for everybody. I put them all
on floppy discs, put a sticker with each MC’s name on it,
each one on a floppy disc I filled with beats for their solo
albums: 20 discs for Meth, 20 for Ghost — over 150 discs.

I had completed many chambers in production train-
ing by the time I moved into this basement. After Method
Man’s Tical went platinum in its first few months, the
publishing deal landed me a lot of money. But instead of
buying a car or whatever rap stars were supposed to do,
I turned that basement from a beat laboratory into a
fully independent studio, a place we could complete en-


lire albums. This is where I had my steepest learning
curve, in the years 1994-96.

This place became a dojo — Japanese for “place of the
Tao” — a space for gathering, training, spiritual growth.
11 might not have looked it. All we did in that basement
was make music, smoke weed, and cook turkey burgers.
You’d hear burgers frying, chess games going, and the
video game Samurai Showdown being played. But every-
thing else was music.

When I bought my first house, in Cleveland, Ohio, I
sent my family there, but I stayed in New York to live and
work. I didn’t come out of that basement for years, liter-
ally. Scientists have said that it takes ten thousand hours
of practice to become a master. I’d been making hip-hop
music since I was thirteen, but down in this laboratory I
probably rounded out the last few of those ten thousand,
recording, mixing, studying, creating — learning. In that
basement I made ODB’s Return to the 36 Chambers, Rae-
kwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, and GZA’s Liquid
Swords — all in ’95.

When we did Tical and 36 Chambers in Manhattan
studios, I always felt the demos sounded better than the
final product. There was a rawness missing. I also felt
that the established engineers I was working with didn’t
know what they were doing when it came to my music.
So I decided that I had to set up everything where no one
would hear it, no one would engineer it, but me. And
that’s what I did.

W When we worked on Cuban Linx, there was no engi-
ne neer. Not a single knob was twisted by anyone but me.
When we did Killah Army, Sons of Man — we did all these
albums in that basement, without spending any money.
Later, I heard some people say they thought I was being
egotistical when I had the albums say, “mixed, produced,
and arranged by the RZA.” They’d say, “He doesn’t know
how to mix; he doesn’t know how to arrange; he’s not
an engineer.” They didn’t know that I knew every sin-
gle board function in and out. I had to. By the time we
were doing Cuban Linx, I was at one with the producer’s
medium.

Producing music is like playing an instrument — it’s
an expression of yourself. Every pianist touches the keys
differently, every violinist bows based on the strength of
their arm, the structure of their hand. That’s why Miles
Davis is one of the greatest players, because of the spirit
that he blows through that trumpet. It’s his. Creativity
is always unique, because it’s you. It’s the same thing
with producing — you have to sit there, find yourself in
the sound.

You don’t need someone asking you “You want some
more bass on your kick?” or giving you a scientific expla-
nation of how it should be. A lot of engineers went to
school for this, so they’ll tell you, “If the vocals are at two
kilohertz, your snare should be either above that or below
that so it doesn’t clash with the vocals.” But I found that
sometimes the snare has to clash with the vocals to punc-


luate them. You have to ignore the science of it, even the
logic of it. Sometimes real discoveries take a leap in con-
sciousness that’s outside the intellect.

One thing I discovered was that you could have ten
unrelated things playing at the same time, as long as each
was at the right amplitude. So even though the track
might not be on beat, because of the volume level of the
drums, the pulse forces everything to fall on beat. That
way can put one thing at a tempo of 1 00 beats per minute,
another at 20, another at 150, with the drums going at a
steady tempo of 95. Everything else — it might be strings,
a bass sample from a Stax record, a sample from a Russian
choir — can he made to fall into place. You use a synthe-
sizer to pick out certain notes and frequencies from the
samples, to bring that out of the mix, to let the ear tune
into that, to create a form. In a song like “4th Chamber,”
the melody line of the keyboard is what makes the other
noise stick together.

One day, one of my students, a producer named True
Master, noticed something. We were in the studio, and
he accidentally hit a fader and the whole beat fell apart.
)ust one fader, one track, one instrument — and the whole
thing fell into chaos. Another time, he was listening to
me mixing a song — just kicking back, smoking weed,
and listening — and he kept pointing to one line that was
off. “That’s off, that’s off,” he’d say, pointing to the fader
of one track. And when I finished balancing everything,
he realized that it was only off until it was balanced.

if That’s the whole secret to it: It’s off, but it isn’t off. It’s off
H6 and on at the same time.

Music only needs a pulse. Even just a hum will force
a pulse, a beat. It makes order out of noise. It’ll work with
anything. I think that’s what true producing is: finding
music. You listen and you can hear it.

Today, making music, making beats — it’s like breath-
ing for me. I have thousands of beats I’ll probably never
release, but I can’t stop making them any more than I can
stop breathing. You’re a vehicle for your breath, and I’m
a vehicle for the music breathing through me. If you look
at more of your daily creativity like that, it helps you to
be more productive. You get out of the way. The kung-fu
principle of wu-wei teaches us how to act without action.
In the phrase, the word wu translates as “without.” It
means that you use the power of the universe but use it
without effort, bring yourself into balance with the flow
of life. It’s a daily thing, an hourly thing.

A few floors above my basement in the town house,
family members of the Queens hip-hop group Organized
Konfusion were living. I remember Prince Po used to
come around and check me out making beats and
rhymes. It’s funny that I’d be visited by a member of Or-
ganized Konfusion because that’s exactly what I was
practicing a couple floors below: organized confusion.
I was making music, but I was also practicing some-
thing spiritual. I was trusting chaos and confusion — not


judging it, not fearing it, not reaching for an immediate
solution. That’s not just a secret to production. It’s a se-
cret to life.

You and your life — it has a consistency, no matter
what you go through. You just have to be detached
enough to recognize the good and the bad in yourself
and not judge either one. You are a 64-track recording —
the tracks are always there, they’re always with you.
Sometimes the harsh tracks are cranked up and the rest
are rolled down to zero. Other times the sweet tracks are
high and the darkness is low. But it’s all you.

I came to think that we all have many faces. I always
refer to the zodiac. Why do they have all these different
creatures to represent different periods in the year? I
think it’s because those are all the different qualities of a
man in different seasons. In the Wu-Tang Clan we took
on so many names, identities, and alter egos. But you
could also see all nine of us in one person. There’s some-
thing about me I got from Meth. There’s something
about me I got from Dirty. There’s something about
Dirty in every other member. There are all these different
identities in each of us.

When I was setting up 36 Chambers studio, I made a
point to get eight different compressors — one for each
voice in the Wu-Tang Clan. That way, once I found the
way I wanted someone to sound, I never had to touch it
again. Every time Ghost walked in, there was Ghost’s

compressor — I’d patch him right into it. That gave it a
consistency throughout the album. Today on Ghost’s al-
bums, he might sound one way one minute and slightly
different the next — because you have different engineers,
different compressors, different mikes, different equip-
ment. But at 36 Chambers, I feel I became a part of those
MCs’ voices and they became a part of mine. I wanted us
to have parameters — so you could come in and know
who you were, what you’d sound like.

One of my main inspirations for creating a record
company and creating my own music was reading about
Stax Records. I read the book and I saw how they put
up thirty-five dollars to start their record company. I
saw how David Porter and Isaac Hayes were sitting
there writing all these songs and making all this music
and that they used the same band, Booker T. and the
MGs with Steve Cropper for many of the hits that went
up to 1972. 1 read this while I was walking and forming
my company.

Stax had what? A sound. Motown had what? A sound.
Every song was recorded where? At Motown. At Stax. My
idea was that every song would be recorded at this place,
and I gave it the most obvious name it could have: 36
Chambers. Because that’s exactly what it was: the thirty-
sixth chamber of my studies — the place I brought my
wisdom to the world.

But like most things in life, that chamber had to


close. Right after Cuban Linx I went straight into Liquid
Swords, nonstop. Everyone else in the Clan went off to do
I heir tours, shoot their videos, do their careers. I stayed
in the basement to keep working. But soon came the
end of that chamber, the closing of that circle. Because
right at the end of making Liquid Swords, it happened:
a flood.

The town houses were built in a group with one drain-
age system. There was a big rainstorm, and even though
1 had built everything up a foot off the main floor, the
water rose up three or four feet and destroyed my studio.
It made me think of that flood back on Dumont Avenue,
in Brooklyn, when I was a kid. Water is like that in my
life — it brings destruction. And like the kid says in Shogun
Assassin, from the sample that begins Liquid Swords :
“That was the night everything changed.”

Liquid Swords was pretty much done, but that was
it — the studio was gone. In a way it was like the destruc-
tion of the Shaolin temple, which caused all the monks
to scatter. It was 1996, and I still had to do Ghost’s Iron-
man, but I had to do it somewhere else. Even though
people like that album a lot, Ghost’s voice doesn’t sound
as good as it did on Cuban Linx, because we had to go to
someone else’s studio to do it — we had to leave Shaolin.

We bought the Wu House in New Jersey and built a
studio downstairs there. We built another studio in Man-
hattan. I made a deal with Sony for twelve million dollars

in Manhattan. Then it was time to do Wu- Tang Forever.
In four years, we’d gone from nine niggas from Stapleton
and Park Hill to worldwide celebrities. Wu-Tang Clan
was carrying our wisdom from Shaolin to the world.

The world had some wisdom to throw right back
at us.


Confusion is a gift from God.
Those times when you feel most
desperate for a solution, sit. Wait.
The information will become clear.
The confusion is there to guide you.
Seek detachment and become

llieory, it’s positional, and the game may go on for sixty,
seventy moves. Everything you do is to put yourself in a
position for the endgame. It’s thirty choruses. With the
King’s Gambit, you’re hoping there isn’t going to be an
endgame. You’re just trying to get this game over fast. A
lot of those games end in twenty moves, if somebody’s
good maybe thirty moves. It’s like the Wu-Tang sword

THE OTHER CHEEK


A MEDITATION ON KUNG FU
AND CHRISTIAN MERCY

if

The written characters in the word Tao break down in
such a way that the word literally means “the Path of the
Warrior.” A lot of us need to think like a warrior in our
lives, even when we’re at peace.

A warrior is not simply someone who gets into a lot
of fights. A warrior doesn’t fight — he kills. When a war-
rior takes on wisdom, he makes a circle around your
punch — he’ll lean back to fend off a blow, and if he has
to, he’ll come back in and kill you. It’s a wiser form of
fighting, and you see it in all different forms of combat-
physical, strategic, military, business.

Jesus said, “Turn the other cheek.” That’s good advice
on many levels. For one thing it takes something out of
you to hit a man. It hurts you to do it. But a warrior
would take Jesus’s advice in a martial arts way. In a street
way, it means, if a nigga gonna punch you in the face, you
pull back, then come in and fuck him up for real. I’ve


seen this happen to my cousin, Sixty-Second Assassin. A
guy tried to punch him in his face, Sixty-Second turned
his head, and the fist just slid off him. Also Sixty-Second
uses Vaseline in a fight to stay slippery, to prevent con-
lact. That’s swift and wise. That’s when turning the other
cheek becomes strategy, not just righteous living.

GANGSTA CHI


A MEDITATION ON ART AND VIOLENCE

m

In the mid-’90s, we saw a division of violent music and
violent lyrics. In the one case, you had hard-core hip-hop
from the East Coast, which had violent-sounding music
as well as violent lyrics. But then suddenly, you had West
Coast G-funk and music like Biggie Smalls — niggas rap-
ping violent lyrics over smoothed-out beats. The smooth
music attracts more listeners — you put sugar in any-
thing, it makes more people eat it. But it changed the
public in a strange way.

If the music sounds violent — like “Bring the Mother-
fuckin’ Ruckus” — that gives the listener a chance to get
his violence out into the air. But if you have a violent lyric
on a smoothed-out beat, that violence goes straight into
your mind. If you’re saying, really quietly, shit like “So I
saw the motherfucker and I shot ’em . . . And I knew
when he dropped that I got ’em . . .’ all with a smoothed-
out flow? Over R&B beats? You’re not getting it out.



THE

you re not releasing that chi. You’re getting enticed, the
pressure is building.

Gangsta comes in many forms. You can watch a movie
like Die Hard, which is full of violence that’s in your face.
But if you watch a movie like The Godfather, the violence
is subtle — it’s in a word, a nod, a gesture. I think you
walk out of Die Hard and leave something in the theater.
With Godfather, you walk out with something put in you.
Hip-hop is the same way. The smooth gangsta shit puts
it into you — which is cool, in a way. But the hard-core
shit gets it out of you, and I think that’s better. Other-
wise, you have it all bottled in — you go to your car, drive
home, and kill your wife.


PEACE


H

The word comes from Islam and is meant to be a univer-
sal greeting. It’s the only word I use to begin and end
each communication with my fellow man. “Peace” — it’s
the absence of confusion. “Peace” — it’s the prevention of
conflict. “Peace” — it establishes both parties on a ground
of mutual respect no matter who they are. “Peace” — it’s
universal. If an alien jumps in front of your ass — comes
at you, like “ BLAAH !” — you can still say “Peace.” He may
even understand you.

Peace. The whole energy of the word itself is good.

Peace.

But as they say, come in peace, but prepare for war.

once the idea is manifest, you don’t need the trap. When

DISSOLUTION


How can I put it? Life is like video footage

Eighty-proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice

Ginseng boost, I got your neck in a noose

Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct

Sixteen-bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko

Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us

And we return like Jesus, when the whole world need us

For what does it profit a man to gain the world
and lose his soul.

I n 1997, we began to make our second album as Wu-
Tang Clan. It was only four years after our debut, but
everything was different. For one thing, four of us were
platinum-selling solo artists. So the number four came to
reveal itself in a new rule. In a group of nine, beware of
the number four. If four members are not with you on
course, the vessel will not reach its destination.

I knew the only way to record that album was to take
everybody away from all the homies and ties in the East.
So a crew that helped reestablish hip-hop’s East Coast
Mecca had to go west. We moved to Los Angeles — stayed
in the Oakwood Apartments, started recording at Amer-
aycan Studio in West Hollywood.

The year was ’97 — a very serious number in Mathe-
matics. I remember telling everyone that this was the
year — the year of 9 and 7, the year of Born God. 9 and 7
is 16, and 1 and 6 is 7. This was a rare year, a rare chance.
I even said it in a lyric, in the song “Reunited”: “We re-
turn like Jesus when the whole world need us.” That’s
how I felt at the time — like we were being called to re-
unite for the good of the world.

We stayed in Los Angeles for months, recorded the
double album Wu-Tang Forever, and released it in June.
It went to number one in the first week. We were the big-
gest music group in the world. And that was it; the five
years were over. The plan was completed.


On some level, right when that happened, I could feel
my power was gone. Even when we were recording the
album, I realized the Clan was no longer a dictatorship
with me telling who to get on what song and what to do.

It had become more free, a democracy. It had to it was
just nature, the Way.

With Wu-Tang Forever, we had all fulfilled our des-
tiny. My brothers in the Clan had lived up to their five-
year promise, and I had lived up to mine. The planets
had aligned, the cipher was complete. There was no more
prophesy involved; everything else was gravy. Our future
was no longer ordained.

The album dropped in June. By August it was over.
Wu-Tang left Shaolin and got lost in the countryside-
separated, pulled apart.

It was a tour that did it— with the L.A. rock group Rage
Against the Machine. This was my idea. Since we had a
number-one album, we could have made more money
than we would on this tour, but I felt I was taking the long
view. I wanted to consolidate our fans with mainstream
America.

Let’s just say this wasn’t a universally accepted strategy.
Wu was strong like a motherfucker on that tour, but back-
stage, brothers would say, “Yo, why we on tour with these
white boys? I wanna go rock with my niggas.” I could
understand that. They wanted to feel that energy, share
that triumph. But I said, “Look, we do the white boys in
the summer and do the black colleges in the fall.

Instead, we dissolved. We had the world in our hands
and we dropped it. One moment crystallized what was
happening: thirty thousand kids holding up Ws with
only three or four members onstage. It was so embar-
rassing, so totally crushing. The first time that happened
was in Cleveland, then there was another disaster in Chi-
cago that involved missing members, violence, police,
and the whole nine.

At this point, no one in my crew was hearing me.
Method Man was double platinum, Raekwon was plati-
num, Ghostface was platinum, Dirty was close to platinum,
GZA was close to platinum — these were all real stars now,
with all the ego, power, and confusion that comes with
that. The only ones who weren’t to that degree were Deck
and U-God, and they were the motherfuckers onstage
every day.

One day on the bus, I finally just said, “Fuck this, it’s
over. I can’t do this. I can’t keep fronting on our fans and
fronting on ourselves.” We pulled out of the tour in Au-
gust, halfway through. And the Wu-Tang Clan scattered.

When the Shaolin temple was burned down, Shaolin
was infiltrated by outside forces. In their case, it was the
Manchus. In our case, it was money, fame, and ego. In
both cases, the masters scattered — some left with inten-
tions to rebuild; others took different paths. Shaolin
would survive, but it would never be the same. And nei-
ther would I.


For me, this was death — the death of a certain person
inside me. If I was the abbot, the leader, that man had
ceased to exist. I felt I gave my life to this cause, and that
life was in ruins. I’d spent two years living in a basement,
and that time changed me. Prince Rakeem was gone. I
wasn’t that same Polo-wearing cool motherfucker my
friends grew up with. Now, I was this Afro-nappy, fang-
mouthed Gravedigga-type kid — this monster. In photos
of me back then, I look older than I do now. The prince
had become a funky-smelling workaholic down in the
lab three days straight, not bathing, not eating. I was like
Frankenstein, because I didn’t care. I thought it was
worth it.

Now I wasn’t sure. I thought ’97 would be the year of
Bom God, of new birth. But at this moment, it felt like
death.

Not only was I let down by the brothers, but my wife
betrayed me. She ended up hooking up with another
man. I just couldn’t believe that. For the RZA’s woman to
have an affair — how the fuck could that happen? I was
heartbroken. In September, after the defeat of the tour, I
headed back to my house in New Jersey — a place I’d orig-
inally bought as a Wu house — defeated, depressed, lost.

I got there early in the morning on September 7. I’d
been drinking, smoking, doing all types of drugs all night
long. I knew my family was in the house, but it was a
broken family. I couldn’t even look at my wife. In fact, I

W couldn’t even get in my own house — the doors were all

136 locked.

It was the crack of dawn, and I went to lie down on
the grass. I don’t know how much time passed, but after
a while something strange happened.

My boy Kinetic was with me, crashed out on the
grass, and when I got up, he noticed something. There
was a flower there, right where I’d been lying — like it
grew under me during the night. He picked it up and
showed it to me. I took it in my hand.

I must have looked at that flower for an hour or so —
just zoned out, with my spirit doing weird shit, like I was
seeing Heaven. All there was, for that period of time,
was that flower. It was beautiful, moist, and full of life.

Time passed; the sun came out. Kinetic picked up an-
other flower, tied it in a knot. Then he slid his finger across
the flower. You could see that it had lost all its moisture. 1
looked at the flower I was holding and saw that it wasn’t
moist anymore either. And then — bing ! — it came upon
me. Enlightenment. And I was free.

In the years since then, I’ve tried to explain what hap-
pened to me that morning. I still don’t know if I can. I
saw that the flower grew. I saw how the sun causes all
things to grow. But I also saw that by noon, that flower
was dried out and dead. In a way, I could actually, physi-
cally feel the rightness of this — that there’s a beginning
and end of physical things. It showed me that it was okay
this moment had passed. A flower grew under me, where


no one would expect it to. It was beautiful, moist, and
l ull of life. Then by noon, it was dry and dead. It had run
its course.

I got up off the grass.

I’d been telling everyone this was ’97, year of Born
(; 0( J — saying they had to realize the existence of God
in themselves. But on the seventh day of the ninth
month of ’97, it happened to me. I was the one who was
reborn. On 6/6 came 36: On June 6, 1 saw 36 Chambers
on TV — a vision that inspired a style, a hip-hop crew, a
rap phenomenon, everything the Wu-Tang Clan be-
came. On 7/9 came God Born, meaning God born into
existence, and another vision that freed me — from ego,
isolation, and every burden that came with it.

It’s a basic hip-hop lesson that’s tough to learn. The
second you pick up a mike, it’s about you. You’re telling
people who you are, where you’re from, how you domi-
nate and control. But Taoism says that to remember the
Great Way means to remember your connection with all
of creation. It teaches you to harmonize your personal
will with the natural harmony of the Way. That is, don’t
lake your car keys and hand them over to your ego. If you
do, you’ll crash.

On the way up, you do all the things driven by ego.
But when you get to your destination, you have to let go
of the ego. It’s a balancing act you can achieve only if you
let go a little bit, act more generously with your time and
creativity.

Up to that point, I believed I owned hip-hop. If you
read my old interviews, you see it. Hip-hop belonged to
me and my crew. It belonged to the East Coast. It be-
longed to New York. It belonged to the black man. Then
I realized something. Hip-hop didn’t belong to us. It be-
longed to the world. In a sense, I saw the larger flow of
the world; I saw the harmony in it. I saw that no one
could control these forces.

But just because it belongs to the world doesn’t mean
you should let anybody abuse it. That’s the problem. If
something is sacred, people want to protect it, keep it to
themselves. Jesus said, “Neither cast ye your pearls before
swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn
again and rend you.” That’s why you’re so protective of
what you think are your pearls.

But Jesus would also say knowledge is free, wisdom is
free, you have to give. It’s the same thing in kung-fu leg-
ends. That’s why the Shaolin temple got burned down.
Because if you don’t care about the outside world and the
outside world is full of wolves eating everything up, when
they’re finished eating everything up, where they gonna
go? To your crib.

I feel like the abbot knew that, the one I sampled at
the beginning of “Reunited,” when he says, “I’m afraid
disaster must come. We must get more pupils so that the
knowledge can expand.” In that movie, they start letting
regular people into the temple. This brings about the de-
struction of the temple but the preservation of it at the


same time. I feel the same way about hip-hop now. What-
ever it will become, it won’t do it by being exclusive. And
I’ve felt that way ever since that morning, when I saw the
light and changed.

Until that morning, I’d had success, but I was small
and twisted inside. Even though I had wealth and fame
and knowledge of self, I wasn’t free from ego. I was se-
cluded, antisocial, aggressive, conceited, and mean. On
9/7/97, 1 became humble. And ever since then, the person
people meet named RZA is all right. Ever since that day,
I’ve been able to talk to people about my life, to tell them
I’m not a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Christian, a gangsta, a
thug, or a prophet. I’m not any one of these things, al-
though in a way I’m all of them. On that day I became
me: a humble warrior, a student again. I became free. I
found peace. And I’ve had it to this day.

“Everything is Everything.”

When Buddha says “All is illusion,” he isn’t saying that
nothing is real. He’s saying that your mind’s projections
onto reality are illusions. He’s saying that the elements in
the universe that form every physical thing we see —
solid, liquid, gas — if they’re taken down to a subatomic
level, they don’t exist. Therefore all we see is an illusion,
because it’s shape or form, not true essence. One reason
why Buddhism was pushed out was that it seemed to
contradict Western ideas of God. To most of us, you can’t
nay “All is void” one second then “Everything has a Bud-
dha nature” the next. But what Buddha said is true.

Your body is your vehicle. And if you put that vehicle
to the service of God’s will? Then that vehicle becomes an
i ntension of God’s hand. This is Moses splitting the Red
Sea. This is Jesus walking on water. It’s that extension —



THE

because the power of the physical is limited only to the
power of the mind and spirit driving or flowing through
it. Everything is everything.


“It’s All Good.”

Both street talk and Zen statement — and true. At the
bottom line, at the end of the day, it is all good. Even if a
bomb explodes and blows up a whole building and all
the atoms and matter that were compressed are released,
once the explosion is over and things settle back down,
it s back to normal again: It’s all good. Even though the
Devil is causing chaos, from the days of the Bible until
now, at the end of the day, God will cast him out. At the
end of the day, good will triumph over evil.

Science reflects this. If God is good, if the universe is
based on a good energy, all will be good — right down to
the subatomic level. Electrons are negative, but they
move around the proton, which is positivity itself. It sits
still at the center and determines the weight of the atom.
No matter what the electron is doing, it’s the proton that
makes everything what it is. Its weight is something like
1,100 times more than the electron’s. The proton is God.
It’s all good.


“Don’t hate the player;

HATE THE GAME.”

That’s good street talk, but it makes practical spiritual
sense too. It derives from the biblical counsel to hate
the sin, not the sinner. In so many words, that’s what
Jesus said: “Don’t hate the player; hate the game.” They
persecuted him for talking righteousness and speak-
ing the truth, so he just said, “Yo, y’all playin’ the game
wrong. You’re out here living wicked and doing this and
doing that, and you’re gonna hate me just ’cause I’m tell-
ing you about it? Don’t hate me, nigga. Hate the situation
you’re in.”

In a way, he even says the same thing to God — which
just shows how powerful Jesus’s spirit was. He’s getting
crucified, and in his last moments on Earth, he looks
down at his killers, sees they’re all pawns in the larger
scheme, and tells God to forgive them — because they
don t know what they’re doing. This is a man who told
God himself, “Don’t hate the player; hate the game.”


“Get in where you fit in.”


One of our main problems in life is knowing your place

MAN AND ANIMAL


m

I don’t eat meat — I’ve been vegetarian since 1995. But
I didn’t stop because I became a Buddhist or a Hindu. I
stopped because I had a revelation I was eating dead
animals.

It began in a restaurant with one of my students — I
had nineteen at that time — and he was eating chicken and
I was eating steak. It was Ponderosa Steak House, all you
could eat. But some of my students weren’t eating any
meat at all. In fact, Dirty and I didn’t eat meat from ages
fourteen to sixteen, but then we started getting into sex
and drugs and that led to us being carnivorous.

But this time, my student saw me eating a steak and
he pointed to the bone. He said, “Look at that, yo,” point-
ing to the blood on the bone. “You eat that?” And I was
like, “Hey, I don’t eat pork, but I think it’s everybody’s
choice.” But something about what this kid said made me
reassess. And from that day forth I didn’t eat red meat
anymore.

I continued to eat poultry and fish. But then one day
1 was eating a piece of chicken and my teeth hit the bone.

My mind said, “Dead bird. This is me. Eating a dead bird.”
Like Fm a fucking fool — what. I can’t think of anything
to eat besides dead flesh? I started thinking about it like,
“I’m alive, I have a life, my flesh is alive. Why should I eat
something that’s dead?” I was still eating fish, but I ratio-
nalized that fish is in such multitude that it didn’t matter
so much. I didn’t feel the death of them as strongly. But
then I realized they’re still all dead — and it felt like the
stupidest thing.

I started reading books about it. One lesson I found
is called the Great Understanding — it might be by Elijah
Muhammed. It said that at one point everything that we
ate was alive — we’d eat from the tree, from the ground,
our droppings would feed the tree. It was all life and
therefore man didn’t die. When he put death into his
body, he started to die.

From that point on, I ate to live.

Why do grown men molest little girls?

Is it because the girl’s breast has swelled

A vagabond, tryin’ to steal clothes from Paragon
Listening to the words of Minister of Farrakahn
Goin’ in circles, like a Ferris wheel

I cherish hope, drownin’ inside the sea of life
Use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to

To far heights so dark that even with a bright light
you couldn’t see a spark of light
While others play ball, I recall

SEVENTH PILLAR OF WISDOM

GODS AND HEROES


Not everyone is meant to make a difference.
But for me, the choice to lead an ordinary life
is no longer an option.


— Peter Parker


I t’s hard to explain what it’s like to be rich, famous, and
from the hood. One way is to think of a superhero.
Someone who has special powers, a double identity,
maybe a secret weakness or two.

Anyone who listens to Wu-Tang knows how deep
comic books run with us — how Meth takes the name
Ghost Rider or Johnny Blaze, how Ghostface takes the
name Iron Man or even Iron Man’s alter ego Tony Stark.
(It’s funny to think how many of our references are in
big-budget Hollywood movies now.) Each member

m could give you a different reason why they chose those

156 names. It’s a way to express a different part of yourself.

Like how you relate to your favorite movie star, how
there’s some face you always make and your girl will say,
“You look just like so-and-so,” and you’ll know you do
because he’s your man, he’s part of your identity — his
wisdom has filled your vessel, if only for a moment. But
alter egos can get deeper as you get bigger. And if you
attain fame and wealth, certain alter egos take on a life of
their own.

In 1997, my life fell apart, my Clan scattered, my girl
of six years and I separated. So I moved out to California
and became someone else. I became a superhero be-
cause that’s exactly how it felt. Think about it. One min-
ute, you’re lying in your yard in New Jersey, locked out
of your own house — heartbroken, depressed. The next,
you’re sitting behind a grand piano in a suite in West
Hollywood, smoking Cuban cigars with Leonardo Di-
Caprio right after Titanic came out — hearing the biggest
star in the world spitting Wu-Tang lyrics at you.

Part of this was a conscious decision that came with
awareness of the power I had. For all the years I was
wealthy, I sat in the basement and didn’t realize it. If you
talked to other guys from the Clan about the mid-’90s,
they all have great stories and had great times. All I had
was turkey burgers, video games, and music. But during
1998 and ’99, 1 made up for lost time. Imagine a man
who is free, far from home, and suddenly aware of his


powers — that’s a superhero. So that’s what I became: I
became Bobby Digital.

History is full of bad men who redeem themselves to
become great. Malcolm X — he came up chasing white
women and sniffing cocaine, but found Allah and
changed. But what about people who have knowledge
and go back to doing wrong? For that you usually have
to look at our superheroes.

Wolverine: He joins the X-Men and becomes a good
guy, but he still goes off by himself for months at a time
to raise hell. He was a killer. The man s a superhero, but
he’d go into a bar, get drunk, and fuck everybody up in
the whole bar. Or even Superman: In Superman III, he
gets hit by bad kryptonite and it turns him evil and he
starts drinking a lot and bullying people. When I saw that
Will Smith movie Hancock, I almost felt Bobby Digital
had to have inspired it somehow. It’s about a superhero
who drinks, smokes, bullshits around, and doesn’t take
his responsibility seriously. He’s trapped between being
a 100 percent good guy and doing bad and no one can
stop him.

I did have certain artistic reasons for it. The label Gee
Street gave me a big deal to do a solo debut as RZA, and
I had planned to deliver a positive, righteous album full
of wisdom called The Cure. But in order to deliver a re-
cord like The Cure, I felt I’d have to be living on a moun-
taintop, a 100 percent vegetarian, deep in some monk
state of transcendence. I wanted to be a living example

*9 of the words I wrote. But let’s just say the time wasn’t

158 right for me to do that. In some ways, I was definitely free

from this world, but no one would have any idea how I
got there or how to get there themselves. So I decided to
show the world how I got there, and the only way to do
that was to introduce a character who represents my
past, my dark hip-hop side. Digi means digital technol-
ogy on one level, and on a slang level, it means weed
dipped in PCP. Both work for Bobby Digital.

A rapper plays a role, but it’s different from acting;
you really do live that role, almost like method acting. So
for Bobby Digital, I was inspired by Robert De Niro —
Bobby De Niro. In Cape Fear he’s a psychopath, in
The Godfather he’s Vito Corleone, in Taxi Driver he’s
an underdog antihero, then in another movie he and
Sean Penn dress up as nuns. He’s always Robert De Niro,
but he lives as Corleone, as Max Cady. I lived as Bobby
Digital.

Like a superhero, I had two identities. If you saw me
at a party, you’d think I was a party animal. But the next
morning, I’d be up studying. I was reading Rumi, the
philosophies of Marcus Garvey, all books from the Three
Initiates — principles of mentalism, correspondence, vi-
bration, polarity, rhythm — studying genetics — The Dou-
ble Helix, The Matrix. I hung out in the hood in South
Central L.A. puffin’ weed, smoking sherm sticks, taking
mushrooms, kicking it with the Black Knights, which
included two Bloods and two Crips. I was teaching them


Mathematics but also exposing them to my lifestyle
they were living the life of a hip-hop star through me,
but they didn’t even have a record out. The wisdom was
pure, but my actions? Not so pure.

I would go hang out with gangbangers but then bring
them to my world — parties in Hollywood, huge houses
in the hills. I took the Black Knights with me to Ohio and
had them all working out, getting in shape, studying,
preparing them to be the next MCs for me. But then we
went to New York and stayed at the Trump Tower for a
month, which I used as a home while recording the
Bobby Digital album. It cost me $100,000 for those nig-
gas to stay there, another hundred grand for me— then I
had to pay for furniture and rug destruction. We’d hang
out on the Plaza’s front stoop right by Central Park,
watching Patti LaBelle walk in while we’re drinking malt-
liquor 40s and smoking the fuck out.

Try to imagine it. One second you’re hanging out
with gangbangers in South Central smoking weed. The
next you’re headed to London to stay with Richard Bran-
son at his crib in London. One minute you’re walking
down the street like a regular dude. The next you’re roll-
ing in a $300,000 bulletproof Suburban turning your
sirens on like you’re a cop. One day you re at home in
New Jersey having dinner with your family which I
tried to keep together. The next you’re in L.A., staying in
the Presidential Suite of the Chateau Marmont. You got
pounds of weed, bottles of sherm, and you’re about to go

W out to a club with five girls. They’re all yours, baby, and
1 60 two of them are sisters — and I don’t mean black girls, I
mean siblings. Later you choose which one to sleep with.
It’s a double life. Hanging with ex-convicts from Staten
Island during the day, appearing with John Lennon’s son
Sean on CNN at night.

In fact, Sean’s father went through a period kind of
like this — after the Beatles broke up and his marriage
was on the rocks. John Lennon goes out to L.A. and flips
out — drinking, drugging, clubbing, losing his shit. He
hadn’t even legally dissolved the Beatles — he was in
limbo. I know what that feels like, and I know a lot of
people don’t come out of periods like that with their
mentality intact — they go crazy, wind up drug-addicted,
spun out.

I wasn’t afraid of that, because I felt free — free to play
a role, to have fun, to make up for lost time. But it cost
me. All the time I was striving to keep RZA away from
Bobby, to keep them as separate entities, but after all the
partying and bullshit, I realized one thing. Even though
I made the album as Bobby Digital, I made the deal as
RZA, so the record company owned the name. I wasn’t
happy about that. I felt that that name belonged to me
and my family — that the RZA should not be owned.

So I went and bought the name back; it cost about
$1.2 million. I felt I had to. Bobby was a way to say what
I was like when I was nineteen years old and fucking


bitches and gun happy. As RZA, I was gonna make my
album The Cure and live righteously. Bobby Digital was
a guy trapped between good and evil. That s how I felt
with all this money, all this knowledge and wisdom, that
no one could tell me I was doing something wrong, be-
cause I could explain it. I had all this creative freedom,
and I just let it run — I let it run like a motherfucker. But
you pay a price for that. And in my case, that price was a
lot more than $1.2 million.

I’d been living like a superhero, wilding out as Bobby
Digital — a master of the universe. Then, in 2000, came
my first lesson from this period. On January 9, my moms
passed away.

I’d just posed with Ghostface for the cover of the
hip-hop magazine The Source. Thats when I got the
phone call. My mom had just died of a stroke, caused
by high blood pressure. That day, January 9, I lost my
superpowers.

They said it best in Spider-Man: “With great power
comes great responsibility.” When Peter Parker first got
his powers, he was a selfish egomaniac; he failed to do
right. He didn’t give a fuck — he was the man, out wres-
tling fools, starting fights. A criminal ran by him and
he didn’t lift a finger to stop him — then his uncle got
killed by that criminal. Peter Parker had to live the rest
of his life without his uncle. That’s how I felt when my
moms died.

I remember she gave me one specific order: Never
have children outside of your home, away from your
wife. Instead, I had kids with four women- That was as
Bobby. I’d gone out and put energy and money to places
that didn’t multiply myself, my people, or rtiy family. And
in a way, I feel I paid for that by losing her.

I always knew the year 2000 would bring big change,
but I thought it was going to be a change in the uni-
verse — I even bought food and preparations for it. I
didn’t know that the change would be personal. Nothing
in this world changed, but in my life, everything did. In
the Nation we call our mother our Old Earth. And losing
mine — it brought me back to Earth.

I remember getting up to speak at the funeral, and I
was surprised by how much joy I felt then, thinking back
on our life together. I remembered the nights we had to
ask someone for four dollars to get grits for dinner. The
night she grabbed me and a butcher knife to go find
those teenagers that mugged me. The soul records she’d
play — Chic’s “Good Times,” “Rock Skate Roll Bounce,”
the O’Jays, Stephanie Mills’s “Street Life.” Then I thought
of the effect one person like her can have on the world.

In the Lessons they tell you not to get tattoos or
piercings — not to disfigure your body — but I do have
one tattoo: the Wu-Tang logo on my left arm. I felt
that I’d give my left arm for this cause. Since then I’ve
seen thousands of those tattoos, if not tens of thou-


sands of them. So at the funeral, I said that my mother
didn’t bear a family, she bore a nation. Through her chil-
dren, millions were inspired — to put tattoos on their
arms, to make music, write books, create movies she
bore a nation.

But she didn’t bear God himself. My life up until then
had been making things happen, running shit. With my
mom’s death, I could feel God telling me something:
“You don’t control everything.” We even learned that in
the Lessons: All you control is your own cipher. One les-
son it says G-O-D: G is for God, O is for cipher, D is for
Div i n e — God’s Cipher (or circle) is Divine. In the Nation
of Gods and Earths we call ourselves Gods, but that truly
means we’re the Gods of our own cipher, and youi fust
cipher is first your physical body, the second your family
and your home. If someone enters your cipher and sub-
mits to your will, if someone joins your crew and submits
to your leadership, then the divine union can work. But
you have to remember you only control your own cipher.

Only God’s cipher is divine.

You learn more, you practice more, you gam more
wisdom and enlightenment, and you might start think-
ing that you’re God himself. That’s because there is some
truth to it. If you were to compare to God an ocean, you
could say that each one of us has a drop of water m us.
In one sense, the drop of water is not the ocean. It s just
a drop of water. It doesn’t have the magnitude of the


163

WU



THE

164


ocean itself. But on the other hand, in that one drop of
water, you can find the vastness, the magnitude of the
ocean. So in that sense, you are the ocean.

Digital life proves this. From one bit of a digital image
or song, you can reproduce the entire thing. It’s the same
with DNA. From one strand of DNA, you can clone the
whole organism. It’s the same with God. From that one
drop of water within us, we are, in a sense, the ocean. But
never overlook the power of the ocean itself. There’s a
beginning and an end to what we do because of physical
bodies. God is eternal. You will return to him, he’s not
returning to you. All water in this world goes back to
the ocean — it gets drawn up into the sky and goes back
to the sea. It’s like what Rumi said: “In order for you to
become the ocean, you have to drown.” If you’re swim-
ming, you’re not truly it. You have to drown yourself.

My mother’s death revealed that truth to me. I came
to the hospital, saw her lying there, and tried to breathe
life back into her mouth. I couldn’t do it. Then I stopped.
I thought, Who the fuck do you think you are ? Then I felt
it: I know I’m special, but 1 ain’t that special. I ain’t Him,
the wise prophet that we read about in the Bible (Jesus).
At that moment in my life, I became willing to drown
myself in that ocean, to submit to Allah’s will. At that
moment, my superpowers left me. Bobby Digital ceased
to be real.

That year, 2000, I learned how much superpowers
cost you, what you lose when you let your ego or your


alter ego run things. But that lesson came with a second
part. That part came a few years later, and it was fatal.


Bobby Digital was an alter ego, but at the end of the day
he was a game. I definitely took that game to the extreme.

I took it to the point where I was getting ready to roll
out at night on some Green Hornet shit: had a suit built
for me like the Dark Knight’s— literally invulnerable
to .45 bullets and knives — had that Suburban, which I
called the Black Tank, made AK- and bombproof up to
government-security-level standards. I even had a butler

almost ready to act as my Kato.

I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to play this
character, but in the end, it was about having fun, about
reliving a hip-hop past that got sidelined when I became
the RZA. Bobby Digital was someone I created as an es-
cape from the pressures of being the RZA-someone
who could rap, act, and even dress in a way that RZA
couldn’t. He was the kid inside RZA. An alter ego that did
not own me. My cousin wasn’t so lucky. The kid I knew
as Russell, the man I knew as Ason Unique, the artist I
encouraged to become OF Dirty Bastard his alter ego
consumed him, took the child from him, took him away
from all of us. And we just stood by and watched.

I’ll never forget the day it happened. It was November
13, 2004. I was with ODB in my studio, 36 Chambers,
on Thirty-fourth Street in Manhattan. I brought him

there to get him away from the other people around
him. He had just missed the biggest Wu-Tang concert, at
the Meadowlands, the night before. Clear Channel told
us that if everyone in the Clan made it they’d give us a
chance to make two hundred and twenty grand apiece.
It would’ve taken only a couple of weeks, and it would
have put a quarter million dollars in ODB’s pocket for a
couple night’s work. He didn’t make it. He had people
pulling him away to do one show for seven grand, an-
other show for five, anything to throw some money in
his pocket, let him hang with a bunch of niggas who just
let him get high and buy drugs.

That afternoon, I was about to leave him to go do an
MTV interview. I went to say “Peace” to him, and I asked
him, “You all right, God?” I could see he was bugging out,
he’d been getting high for days. That wasn’t so new, but
I could sense something worse about him this time. Then
he did something that made me feel he was stepping over
the boundaries of who he was and what Allah meant him
to be — and that really disrespected his being.

I have only a slight understanding of why he did this,
but he sat his son down and made him watch him do his
drugs. His son got up to leave, and ODB grabbed him
and said, “No, man. You sit the fuck right here.” And I
was like, “Yo, I’m out.” And he grabbed me with this
grip — I should have recognized it; it was the grip of
someone drowning — and he said, “You’re not going no-
where either.”



So his son and I were sitting there, and he was smok-
ing his drugs, and I could feel that he was offending
something. He was offending me, I think he was offend-
ing his son, and he was offending himself. I had never
seen him do this before. Then he showed me something
that I pray I never feel, I pray that no one ever feels. He
showed me he had lost his vision and all understanding
of who he was.

This man was a scientist, a man with vision. Trust me,
the man who became ODB, Ason Unique, my cousin, he
was a scientist and a minor prophet. This guy could ex-
plain anything to you, just from instinct. He had an in-
nate understanding of the world around him. People
may not know this from the outrageous character he
played, hut ODB was a visionary. But he decayed, he lost
that vision. In a way, his Bobby Digital phase took over
his whole life— it destroyed the man named Ason, the
kid named Rusty.

From the time they put him in jail to all the drugs he
was doing to all the stress he went through with his fam-
ily, it took away his ability to see. And this night, he sat
there and looked me in the eye and said, “RZA, I don’t
understand.”

That shook me. 1 said, “What don’t you understand?
It’s simple, God.”

He said, “Nah. I don’t understand.”

I was like, “G, you gotta understand. It’s real. It’s eter-
nal. It’s in you. It’s there.”

And he said, “I don’t understand.”

Now, I know that right there, right when he said
that — we lost him. Eight hours later, ODB was gone.

He left us with two lessons.

The first I never want anyone to forget: When you
enter the path of wisdom, of knowledge, of life — don’t
turn off that road.

Jesus said, “Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the
gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and
there are many who go in by it.” The wide road — that’s
all around you, it’s easy to take, and many people will
drag you down it. But find that narrow road, that straight
focus, that tunnel of life. When you’re on that, stay on it.
For ODB to say in his last moments “I don’t understand” —
that makes me say I don’t ever want to feel that. I want to
always understand. I always want to have faith. But faith
can leave you if you don’t practice it, don’t exercise it — if
you let it die inside you. Practice your faith.

The second lesson ODB left us with is just as impor-
tant. It’s about freedom and your cipher — your circle,
your family, the people you love.

Death has many causes — -violence, scheming, abuse —
but a major one we overlook is neglect. We say, “Oh, he’s
a grown man. He can drink what he wants to drink,
smoke what he wants, say what he wants to say.” But
Martin Luther King said that freedom has its own laws;
it’s not without its own principles.

You’re free to go fi'om New York to Virginia traveling


north and going around the globe. You could do it, but
you’d have to travel around the world. You’re free to
smack someone in the face. You do have that freedom.
But they have the freedom to smack you back. That’s
justice.

I remember thinking about that after I learned the
Fourth Lesson in the Twelve Jewels, Freedom. Freedom
has a law, and that’s Justice. But I don’t think I truly un-
derstood that until we lost ODB. Equality is the respon-
sibility of every man to one another. If you really want
equality and freedom and justice for all, you got to be
able to say, “Yo, son. You’re drinking too much. You’re
free to do what you want, but it’s gonna kill you.”

My cousin ODB died because we didn’t pay enough
attention. We let him do what the fuck he wanted. I tell
my friends now, “Don’t ever not stop me if I’m fucking
up. If I’m being a dickhead, let me know, please.” You
have to do that, especially if someone is family. Especially
if you love them.

I’ve even pulled brothers aside on the street and said,
“Yo, G, the way you’re acting you’re disrespecting all of
us, man. They’re already looking at us as niggers and
you’re confirming it.” Even in a movie theater, like when
brothers get excited and yell at the screen. I know that’s
a big joke about our community, but it’s not right. I
mean, it’s a movie — if it makes you laugh, laugh; if it gets
you excited, get excited. But have some respect for your-
self and the others that are watching.

It# My speech at Dirty’s funeral was different from the

170 one I gave at my mom’s. It was not joyous. I spoke out
against everyone in my family including myself. I said
that we had all sat there and let a motherfucker we loved
be hurting and didn’t help him. We allowed this negativ-
ity to exist when we knew it was wrong because we didn’t
want to hurt his feelings. Now we’re all in pain.

It’s like they said in the Civil Rights movement, if one
man is lynching a man in front of twenty men — all
twenty men are guilty. They’re allowing it. They’re guilty
of a negligence of righteousness. You have to care for
others. There’s always someone among you who has to
teach those that don’t — even if just by example.

There’s a statement on a piece of paper that I’d give
my girl or my students, a piece of paper I’ve had since I
was fourteen years old. It’s titled “Maturity,” which it de-
fines as “the ability to change what must be changed, to
accept what can’t be changed, and to know the difference
between the two.” That same idea comes up in different
sources. It’s even in a Mother Goose rhyme: “For every
ailment under the sun, / There is a remedy, or there is
none; / If there be one, try to find it; / If there be none,
never mind it.”

It’s also in something called the Serenity Prayer, as-
cribed to St. Francis of Assisi: “God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I can’t change, the courage to change
the things I can, and the wisdom” — the wise-dome — “to
know the difference.” Again, knowledge means knowing,


but wisdom means acting— acting on what you know,
seeing the person who’s drowning right the fuck in front
of you, and stepping in.

My mom’s death ripped something from me that isn’t
coming back. But it forced my mind and heart to remem-
ber, to accept what I can’t change and get the freedom
that comes with that. But ODB taught me— taught all of
us— the flip side of that. When we neglect others out of
superficial wisdom, fake respect, phony knowledge-we
tell ourselves it’s their life; we say it’s not our respon-
sibility; we don’t want to get involved. Fuck that. Get in-
volved.’ Or we’ll all feel the pain.



SOUL


A MEDITATION

**

Spirit and soul are different. Spirit is an idea, a
potential — it’s the fire before a match is struck. The soul
is a product of God. If man is a mathematical, biochem-
ical equation, the soul is that equation’s starting point.
It’s the dot in the yin or the yang. The soul is that drop
of water from God expressed in the flesh.



Drugs can possess you,
but so can your mind.
Learn how to use it,
how to direct it.


Don’t give your mind
to a demon.



DIGITAL BRAIN


A PARABLE OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE

m

In 1996, a computer called Deep Blue defeated the world
chess champion Gary Kasparov. Deep Blue is a frightening
opponent but an even more frightening idea — a com-
puter that could beat the greatest chess player in the world,
but then Kasparov came back and beat it. There’s a lesson
in there: A man’s thought process can defeat the mathe-
matical calculations of a giant computer — because the
randomness of a man’s mind is incomputable.

I don’t think a computer can process information to
even 10 percent of what the human brain does. The
brain’s got mad shit going on in your body right now.
Every cell in your body, even to duplicate one cell — blood
cell, skin cell, brain cell — to pump the blood, then repro-
duce everything every day. It’s insane what the brain has
to do. Man is supreme.

Even so, the computers are catching up. That’s why I
feel that man has to become digital. The way things are
going with computers and technology, we can’t get so


that we rely on them completely. We’ve got to be able to
have a concept of digitally within our own selves as well,
so that we’re always the masters of it.

What man has to do is apply wisdom to his own unpre-
dictability. Right now, man is not always using wisdom.
He’s letting computers do it. And when a computer can
logically outthink a man— that’s a frightening step. I’ve
read some chess masters saying that they can do rare pawn
moves that seem illogical but will fuck the whole com-
puter up and they end up beating it. I believe they re
pointing the way. We must find and use a logic that’s not
programmable.



DIGITAL CULTURE


ART IN THE AGE OF ONES AND ZEROS

w

Nowadays, if you say something funny or smart, you’ll
hear someone say to you, “Oh yeah, what’s that from?”
And you’re like, “I made it up, motherfucker.” Sampling,
cutting, pasting, referencing — digital culture is so deep
in people now that we forget there’s such a thing as orig-
inality. Many people don’t trust a new sound or idea if
they don’t know where it’s “from.”

I’ve even said to myself, What’s the use of making more
music when it’s all here already? I may not have discov-
ered it, but it’s really already here. Those same twelve
notes have been here since the beginning. The combina-
tions may be almost infinite, but it all has the same basic
limited foundation. Whether it’s being sampled or not,
it’s the repetition.

I don’t see the cultural effects of sampling as being all
bad, not by a long shot. But just when options should be
more diverse, there’s some force countering that, making
things more limited. I was listening to some vinyl the


other day. I bought a New Birth record, the song “Wild-
flower,” and I got the MP3 of it too. If you play the two
back-to-back, it’s insane. They sound almost nothing like
each other, even though they’re the same song, same re-
cording, same mix, everything. It’s reduced, simplified,
lost. This generation is missing half the picture.

It’s a way of simplifying life — and that’s something
that you have to do sometimes, for good reasons — but if
you do it too much, you lose reality. You risk losing your-
self. I believe that what’s happening with digital sound
and image is prophetic for our culture. With high-def
TVs, cable, and everything, our vision is getting sharper.
But with the reduction of music to MP3s, at least the way
the technology is now, the sound is getting smaller, sim-
pler, blunter. What does that mean? We’re getting accus-
tomed to better image and worse sound.

This reminds me of the old movie Running Man,
where TV producers and the government collude to alter
a public news event to make it look as if the heroic res-
cuer is actually a murderer. In a way, when TV went
digital, we lost a foothold in reality. Now, we’ll never
truly know if what we’re watching is real or has been
altered and transmitted to us. Digital culture brought a
step away from truth.



DIGITAL DJINNS

A CAUTIONARY TALE

m

They say LSD can induce a consciousness of your con-
nection to God and yourself. I think PCP can too. The
one thing I feel is dangerous about it, as with any drug, is
this: The body is a vehicle to the mind, and if it’s a vehicle,
anybody can drive it. So watch what shit enters you. You
might let a spirit in that’s not you — like when you see a
nigga and you know that nigga changed.

The spirit of fire exists in the air — it just needs to be
combusted. In the same way, I believe we will certain spir-
its into existence. I know because I had that experience on
PCP where I was truly possessed by a demon.

It was years ago, in California. Digi is PCP mixed with
weed, which is better for you, but this time I did PCP not
mixed with weed. PCP is a very powerful thing. All I re-
member out of the whole thing was struggling for my
life. It felt like fifty people were on me — I saw them, felt
them. Meanwhile, the only people there were me and my
brother Freedom. He was in pain for a month.


The Koran talks about supernatural creatures called
djinns— which is where we get the word “genie.” They’re
spirits with their own wills. They have less intelligence
than a man but greater physical strength. Some are good,
some are evil. I think what happened to me that day was
that I exited my mind space into this hallucination world
and let something else into my mind space— like a djinn.
They said my voice wasn’t the same. I was possessed.

NOVICE MIND


A GUIDE TO CREATIVE RESURRECTION

m

When I started making music, I knew nothing about mak-
ing music. I didn’t know any music theory; I didn’t know
where C was on the piano. Since then, I’ve studied music.
I’ve become a Hollywood soundtrack composer, writing
music for eighty-piece orchestras. But as soon as I started
learning, in 1997, something in me changed. I used my
new knowledge to create Wu-Tang Forever, but it’s not as
critically acclaimed. What does that tell you? To me, it tells
you to cultivate the novice inside you. Attack each cham-
ber as a novice.

It’s important to try new things, things you don’t
know how to do. With chess, I feel like I might have been
better before I started studying. I realize that studying has
given me a pattern. Before I started studying, I had no
pattern — you never knew what I’d do. When I was prac-
ticing with a computer recently, I got up to 1650, that’s
pretty good. That means I have only 350 to go to get to
the master level. But I got some advice to study a certain


opening— I studied it for a whole year. It was Josh Waitz-
kin. He’s a master, he told me to study this certain open-
ing, and I did for a year. But all of a sudden it seems that
I’m using that opening and I’m losing with it. Bad op-
ponents, I wipe ’em out. But good opponents sometimes

they’ll beat me with that opening.

The opening is called the King’s Indian Attack. I know
it by heart. I used it against a Sicilian. It goes: 1) E4, the
opponent responds C5, white moves; 2) D3, the oppo-
nent moves E6; 3) white moves knight F3, opponent re-
sponds knight C6; 4) white moves G3, opponent moves
G6; 5) white moves bishop G2, opponent responds bishop
G7; 6) white castles, opponent responds knight F6; 7)
white moves knight C2, opponent castles; then 8) white
goes rook El.

That’s the position. The opening I described would
be best against the French opening, which is used by
many masters. But most club players play Sicilian, which
is why I put it in that order. Sometimes it’s wise to do an
early queen E2, which is a very protective move.

Too many people coast through life, doing only what
they know how to do. I always go back to the basics. Af-
ter Wu-Tang won a Grammy, I began to formally study
music— learning theory, how to read music, how to play
guitar and piano. But now I try to erase what I know to
increase myself. A new piano book I have is called Begin-
ning Keyboard: Grade One. A new chess book I’m reading
is titled My First Chess Opening. It’s for kids.

tions like anger the way I experience sex — I let it in and
let it out. It’s like a thunderstorm; it will pass. I’d been
like that for years — affected by the pains of life, but never
out of pitch for more than two or three hours at a time.
That changed in 2000, when I started losing people that
I loved.

When your mother passes away, it takes you years to
recover. And just as I was starting to get over losing her,
Dirty passed. When I lost them, I lost something I’d had
almost my whole life; vision, an ability to see into the
future. When my mother died, that vision was cut off.
And by 2004, 1 realized it was truly gone.


When my mother left the physical world, I lost one of
my main links to the universe. They say that you have
an umbilical cord and an etheric cord, which is the invis-
ible cord that attaches you to your soul, your mother’s
soul, and all other souls. When one passes away, you re-
ally lose something. It’s physical and mental; it’s real. Part
of you dies.

By 2004, all kinds of cords had been cut. I’d lost my
moms, we all lost Dirty, I had problems with my rela-
tionship at home, and I’d just broken up business ties to
my crew: I gave back all the solo contracts in Wu-Tang.
Dissipating my company lost me millions of dollars, but
it took something even more precious from me. It meant


a physical and creative separation of the Wu-Tang Clan,
which was also a kind of death. All those separations left
me with no sense of purpose, no one to be ambitious
for — left me feeling dead and blind.

I was depressed for years. I didn’t do much, didn’t see
many people, mostly stayed in the crib. Then one night,

I went out.

I went to a club. It was pitch dark in the spot, and I
was in the shadows, physically and mentally. I wasn’t
RZA, wasn’t Bobby Digital, wasn’t a celebrity— I was
just another dude there in the darkness. And out of no-
where, my eyes hit with someone else’s and— bing!—

I got zapped. Right there, I got sparked back to life.

I hadn’t been out at night in months; this woman
hadn’t gone out in a year. This just happened to be the
one night we were both out, both in that spot, at the same
time. Her name is Talani Rabb, which in the Koran and
some African languages translates as “Nourisher of the
Heavens.” And that’s what she was to me. That’s what she
is to me — we’re together to this day. And because of her,

in 2005 my vision came back.

I’m not sure why, but I have some theories. In the tale
of Samson and Delilah, Samson’s strength is in his hair,
and when he tells Delilah this secret, she cuts his hair off.
He loses his strength and he goes blind-literally: The
Philistines blind him. Yet at the last moment, his strength
is returned to him, he destroys his captors, and frees

himself m death. It’s a violent story, but it has a pro-
found truth and beauty. Because to me that story is
about love.

Samson was blind because he was strong— because he
was so powerful, he was vain. He wasn’t humble enough
to really understand God’s mercy and will. It took him
being blinded and treated as a slave, treated like a dog, to
finally, really see the presence of God. And with that vi-
sion, he became stronger than he ever was before. A
woman brought him down-love weakened him-but
that weakness showed him a deeper love, gave him true
wisdom. Knowledge and Wisdom revealed Love through
understanding.

In the most famous story of King Solomon, two
women are fighting over a baby. They go to Solomon to
settle it. Solomon tells them that he’ll cut the baby in
half, one half for each. The one who isn’t the mother says,
Yeah, good idea.” But the real mother says, “Yo, keep the
baby.” She was willing to waive her motherly rights to the
child in order to save his life.

Right there, Solomon uses wisdom to reveal love.
When Knowledge (1) and Wisdom (2) come together—
that’s Love, the twelfth letter. That’s the basis for under-
standing. If you have knowledge and wisdom, you’ll
understand what love is.

Many men don’t understand women, and many
women don’t understand men. And if you’re in a rela-


tionship without knowledge and wisdom, you’re gonna
be dominated one way or another — there won’t be any
justice. The way to start understanding is to look at your-
self. Men and women are not that far apart. Elijah Mu-
hammed taught that 3 percent of a man is missing and
resides in the woman’s form. This relates to the story of
Genesis, where God takes the rib from Adam to make
Eve. Adam, who is incomplete without that rib, finds his
completion only with Eve. (In fact, in the old Wu-Tang
Clan days, we used to call our women our “ribs.”) Physi-
cally, men and women aren’t that different — there’s only
a 3 percent difference genetically — but that difference
creates one of the most powerful forces on Earth. And if
you are lucky enough to find that missing rib in real life,
that so-called soul mate, the strength built from that har-
mony is infinite.

That force helped me regain my strength, but after it
did things were different. Now 1 love my woman, but I
don’t need her like I did. I stay with her by choice. I re-
member the moment I told her, “I love you, but I don’t
need you anymore.” Before, I couldn’t live without her. I
was so fucked up that if she wasn’t there, I wouldn’t have
made it. But with her mercy I got so I could stand on my
own two feet. So I told her, “I was unhappy for years, I
really was lost, and if it wasn’t for you, I would’ve been
fucked up. And I thank you for that. But I got to tell you
that I found myself again and I’m happy. You could leave

tomorrow and I’m good. Do not stay with me to help me.
Stay because you want to. Because I’m good now.”

I know that sometimes you lose your strength, and it
seems like it’s gone forever. But if you let it, that strength
will regenerate. I don t care who you are, if you strive for
it, if you wait for it, if you got the mercy to live to see that
day, it will return. In 2005, my mind rebooted. The num-
bers in 2005 add up to seven— another God year— and
in that year I feel someone pushed reset, and I came back
to life. And I believe that same force is alive today in the
world. Right now — like were all ready to be zapped back
into life.

In a way, we’re resurrecting ourselves. Commentary
like the Haditha says, “The first soul that Allah made was
the soul of Muhammad, and from his souls all other
souls were made.” They say that his soul enters a body-
anybody’s — when it is needed. It’s like Neo in The
Matrix — just by existing he frees all humanity. It’s like
Buddha they say his soul waited thousands of years to
be born. What this tells us is that energy is always there,
waiting to be born. And the people bring it into being-
through our will, our pain, our need. We call what we
need into being— to spark us all back to life.

For example, I believe we brought into being Martin
Luther King Jr.

Years ago, I was like a lot of brothers who grew up
militant in the hood; if I had to choose between Martin
Luther King and Malcolm X, I’d always go with Malcolm.


But when I was sixteen, I heard one of Martin Luther
King’s speeches — about the chemical makeup of a human
being. He said that scientists had broken man down into
his base elements. They found he has enough iron to make
a penny, enough zinc to make some nails, enough fat to
make a little soap, etc. — all of it adding up to twenty-eight
dollars’ worth of chemicals. Therefore, there’s something
intrinsic about man that makes up his true value, some-
thing beyond this physical compound. When I heard that
speech, I realized Martin Luther King Jr. was a scientist, a
blessed man. He gave the “I Have a Dream” speech —
maybe the greatest speech of all time — when he was
thirty-four years old, and worth twenty-eight dollars in
raw chemicals. But his spirit was priceless. He died five
years later, at thirty-nine. We brought him into being be-
cause we needed him.

In a way, I believe this generation called Barack
Obama into being. This moment was prophesied. Even
in the Lessons, it says that the world was given a seventy-
year grace period, from 1934, until an Earth-shattering
change would come. Seventy years after 1934 was 2004 —
the year of Obama’s first speech at the Democratic Con-
vention. In that speech, he referred to his name, Barack,
saying that in his father’s language it means “blessing.”
And I think he really is a blessing for our country.

Or look at the numerology. Obama is the 44th presi-
dent. 4 and 4 is 8 — which is the number that represents
Build. That was his message to terrorists at his speech


189

before the Lincoln Memorial. “You will be judged by
what you build more than what you destroy.” He is here
to build. But the numerology holds even if you consider
the fact that, although he’s the 44th president to be sworn
into office, he’s actually the 43rd man to hold the posi-
tion — since Taft served two nonconsecutive terms. 4 and
3 equals 7 — again, the God number. And Obama won
on the 200th anniversary of Lincoln’s birth. 2 repre-
sents Wisdom and 0 is cipher — it’s Wisdom making
huge change in the world. I believe that wisdom will
save America. For many years, people around the world
were aiming missiles of hatred at us, and the Obama
presidency has already begun to change that. Someone
asked me what happens if he messes up as president, but
I say that Obama can’t mess up. He’s already made
the change just by being elected. A century ago, man
didn’t think he could fly. Once the Wright Brothers
first got twenty feet off the ground and went a hun-
dred yards, that was it. It inspired the whole world — to
the point that motherfuckers are shooting shuttles into
space. That’s what Obama did for us as Americans, as a
people. He released the shackles off our minds, he re-
leased possibility.

This is the hip-hop generation, and that generation
now has a black president. To me, that means it is time
for us all to be men. Not to be kids, not to be boys. It’s
time to recognize the true value in a man — aside from his


loot, his color, his chemistry. And to realize that each man
has that same value, that same potential within him.

Since I’m known to be a student of the Five Percent,
people know I was taught that the white man is the
Devil. But I believe people misunderstand the practical
application of that wisdom. It relates to what Jesus said
about the flesh being weak. Yes, I believe the white man
has a nature he must contend with, and historically, that
nature has been aggressive, violent, conquering, and
prone to devilishment. But to me, there s a simple expla-
nation for that. If you have a birth record of six thousand
years on a planet that’s trillions of years old, with people
who’ve been here for millions of years longer than you,
you’re a baby. You just need to grow up.

So I wouldn’t categorically say that the white man’s a
Devil, the black man’s a God, the woman’s an Earth. I’d
say those attributes are in their nature, but that everyone
can choose what nature they express. They can change.
It also says toward the end of our lessons that any man
made weak and wicked is a devil. That applies to black,
brown, red, yellow, or woman. We all have to change.
Think of what the Reverend Joseph Lowry said at the end
of Obama’s benediction — his last line: “It s time for white
to embrace what’s right.” Yo, G, that’s a bold statement.
He’s saying that to the world — the whole world’s watch-
ing. To me, that’s a challenge to all of us.

Some forces will always fight change, deny resurrec-

tion. Some people see someone like me— someone who
used to be a thug, an outlaw, and has changed— and
they 11 get mad. Even in my own crew, we got a dispute
behind this. Raekwon will be like, “I wanna make music
to punch niggas in the face, and RZA’s on this peace shit.”
Nah, man. I found peace and I’m sharing it.

I am from that era in hip-hop, the era of violence and
attitude. I helped found that shit, because that’s how I felt
at the time. I don’t repudiate it. But at the same time, all
that aggressive, ignorant, nigga-ghetto shit isn’t naturally
me. It was a product of history and my environment.

Man himself, outside of history, is made in the image
of God. God ain’t no nigga. God ain’t no stupid mother-
fucker. God is a prince. Being a killer is not naturally in
any of us. I don’t even think lions are natural killers— it’s
like the taste of blood came later. If you believe in the
Bible and you go to the Garden of Eden, every animal
was there. They were all chilling— there was no death
going on. You have to think that death and killing came
from an evil nature loose in the world.

Of course, you see that nature everywhere today

sometimes in people repping God. Islamic terrorists
would say they sacrifice their lives for God— they’re
doing God’s will. But we’re talking about bombs blowing
up markets, planes crashing into buildings — is that the
work of God or the work of man? To me, it’s simple.
These men not only kill thousands of others, they also
kill themselves. The prophet Muhammad says, “Whoever


kills himself with a blade will be tormented with that
blade in the fires of Hell.” God wants you to live. If we
know nothing else about God, we know that. In fact, I
don’t even believe God wants us to die.

Opposites are not always in a partnership. They are
not always like yin and yang, two sides of the same com.

I don’t believe that life and death have a partnership. I
don’t believe that we have to die. I believe that we make
ourselves die.

I don’t deny the force of decay, the depletion of your
energy. The second law of thermodynamics says that all
physical systems get more and more disorganized over
time, until they reach a state of equilibrium. It says that
time goes in one direction toward chaos until the system
is balanced. I bear witness to that. I just believe the sys-
tem is bigger than most people think. Energy or even
matter cannot be destroyed, only changed in form. So
where is death?

See, I believe death is the biggest hustle there is. It s
the biggest scam— because you can say what you want
about it and nobody can prove you wrong.

The main scam is thatyou have to die to go to Heaven.

This was a strong force in the black community people
put up with anything if they think they’re going to
Heaven. Or with the Arabic jihadists— being promised , 93
gardens and wells because they’re in the desert. You ^

promise people what they lack. It’s a good hustle. Jesus th e

The Lessons taught us that the seventh plane of en-
ergy is consciousness or infinity. Infinity is a natural plane
of our energy. That’s where you are super-conscious. 1
think you can, at that moment, make a choice. At the end
of your body’s physical life, when your physical animated
energy’s running out, you’ll know it. Even if it s one sec-
ond, it won’t feel like one second— because it’s like being
in a car accident when you witness time stop — your
mind is going to erase time for that second. This wisdom
is also reflected in the Tibetan teachings that guide you
through that moment of consciousness between death
and rebirth. You have a moment when you can go wher-
ever you want to go, do whatever you want to do. Use
that moment.

I was telling my children this. I told them, “If we love
each other like this, I don’t ever not want to see you
again. I want to love you forever.” And the only way to
do that is to have such a strong love that it exists even
without our physical bodies. I know that my mother s
not here anymore, but I don’t feel she s gone in death. I
know I’ll never see her walk into my kitchen, but I don t
feel that she’s dead. Her body is dead, but she can t be
dead because life is eternal. And I still see her in my
dreams and in places we never visited in our physical
lifetimes. When we say something is alive, that’s an adjec-
tive describing a state of matter. So being alive doesnt
actually mean having life. Life is beyond the scope of our

1 lost my vision in 2000, and truly knew it was gone
by 004. But in 2005, it started to come back. And later

at year, m September, it came back full force. It hap-
pened when my son was born, in September of 2005 the
moment I saw him come out of my wife.


It s funny. I thought back to the time 1 saw my first
daughter come out, back in 1992 — how that inspired me
to get my life together, to form Wu-Tang, to take on the
world. But witnessing that whole process again, witness-
ing that burst of love in my wife and my life — that hadn’t
happened to me since 1992. But this time, that experi-
ence, that seed coming out — it brought me back. It re-
stored my vision for good.

In the Lessons, of all the Twelve Jewels, the last one
you get is Happiness. You attain Knowledge, Wisdom,
Understanding, Freedom, Justice, Equality, Food, Cloth-
ing, Shelter, Love, Peace — then you’re happy. But there’s
one crucial detail about happiness missing from the Les-
sons we were taught, something I learned about only
recently.

When the Father founded the Five Percent, he com-
piled the Lost-Found Lessons and gave them to the
youth, but for some reason, he took the first page out. I
didn t learn this until Wu-Tang was on tour the first time
after ODB had passed away. That was when I actually got
a copy of the intro to the Lessons. It’s right on the first
page, one most Gods never saw. And what it said was
this: “Set yourself in Heaven at once.”

When I read that, I realized, “That’s it.” That’s the cen-
tral message of all wisdom — not just in the Nation of
Gods and Earths, but of all wisdom: Set yourself in Heaven
now. Immediately. Set yourself in Heaven — right now.

You don’t have to die to go to Heaven. Heaven is on
198 Earth. If you’re fucked up, if shit is floating by you, if
poverty and self-hatred are breaking you down— you’re
m Hell. Set yourself in Heaven at once. When Jesus said
that the Temple of God is in you, he wasn’t speaking
metaphorically. He said, “Thy Kingdom come on Earth
as it is in Heaven. Many people misinterpret that. The
true meaning of that prayer is the same as the Buddhists’
idea of Zen, of finding Nirvana and enlightenment right
now. The key is true consciousness, in the present, in this
moment, right now, where you’re at. Don’t wait for it. Set
yourself in Heaven at once.

Strive for the super-consciousness that comes at the
end of life— strive through meditation, through love,
through building, through creation. Ignore the forces of
darkness, separation, and death. Tune out the voices that
don t want you to grow, to change, to resurrect yourself.
Ignore forces pulling you back into the past.

It s funny. In hip-hop, people have been talking about
back in the day” for about twenty years now. But
that s something people do in general. Your father says,

In my day ...” his father says, “In my day . . . ,” and
before you know it you’re slaves— literally, in the case of
black people, spiritually in the case of everyone. You’re
slaves to the past, to nostalgia. You’re blind to what’s right
in front of you.

To me, Gladys Knight said it best, in the song Wu-Tang
Clan sampled for “Can It All Be So Simple.” In the part



you hear in the song, she says, “Let’s talk about the good
old days.” That’s the part everyone remembers. But in the
rest of that song, she says something else. She says, “These
days now that we’re living will become our children’s
good old days.” There’s real wisdom in that.

It’s like Rumi says, “Past and future veil God from our
sight; burn them both up with fire.” Nostalgia is self-
gratification for those who were there. It’s not a state-
ment of the truth. So fuck back in the day. Open your
eyes to what’s right in front of you. You’re here, now, and
God is within you. Every day is a good old day.

Some people say, “God works in mysterious ways.”
But I don’t think God is mysterious. In fact, the attributes
of Allah don’t even include the word mysterious. Benev-
olent, merciful, all-knowing, all-seeing, omnipotent —
yes. But mysterious? Nah, he’d say. I’m obvious. I’m
everything that you see. I’m right there in front of you.
I’m inside of you.

This year, I have my vision back. I can forecast the
future. But I don’t forecast forming a brotherhood, wag-
ing a war, starting a movement. All I forecast is good,
because that’s all I see. In 2005, 1 had a son. I named him
Rakeem because in a way he was the rebirth of me. His
birth — the love it sparked, the strength it gave me —
made my vision even stronger. But the main thing it let
me see was the presence of Allah in everything.

On the latest Wu tour, I started to say this, plan that,
make all kinds of predictions — then I caught myself. I

said, Nah. I m not in the future-predicting business any-
more. All I predict is good. Even where others get stuck on
the illusion of bad, I’ll be waiting in the midst of the good,
waiting until the aftermath of the bomb or the storm,
because that’s when all returns to calm. That’s where
you’ll see me, building strong, living in the world Allah
manifested.


THE MEANING

The meaning of life is easily stated. Live. Islam. For Ever.
Islam is peace, so what life truly means is, “Live in peace
forever.”

Peace.

It

Peace. As we know, all elements radiate a form of energy.
Fire radiates heat, ice radiates cold, and man radiates
thoughts. Some thoughts are created, others are dupli-
cated and modified. God is the creator of thoughts; the
Devil is the duplicator or impersonator. Yet God and
the Devil both change thoughts. God changes stories
for the better, the Devil for the worse.

It has been said that any thought conceived can be
expressed. These expressions of the thought are dormant.
It has not the qualities of good or bad. It is neutral. It is
a potential energy awaiting to be activated into the ki-
netic. Yet once it is activated, it takes on the expression
of whichever degree it is manifested in. For one may feel
that he has a positive thought, but if he expresses it
wrongly, it becomes negative. Because sometimes what

is positive and good for the individual may be bad for
the group and vice versa. So from this application,
we can see that our personal thoughts must be mastered
and executed correctly. There are approximately five bil-
lion people on the Earth, and they all have the power to
radiate thoughts. Yet out of all these different thoughts,
there is only one truth. Although all men have their own
thoughts of what, where, why, when, and how. And they
also manifest ideas of who, if, and but. Regardless of
these billions of thoughts, there’s only one truth. Every-
thing else is an illusion.

An example of this can be shown through simple
mathematics. One plus one equals two. Meaning, one ob-
ject plus another object equals two objects. That is the
truth in any language. This can be shown and proven,
and mathematics cannot lie. It is the language of God. So
that no matter how many thoughts exist there is still just
one truth.

When a man lies to the next man, who is really being
played for the fool? For the truth always reveals itself in
its own good time. And a lie is only an illusion. For even
when you lie to someone, he or she might not know
the truth, but the applicator of the lie knows the truth.
And that shows that the truth always exists and a lie is
only a temporary illusion that vanishes once the truth is
manifested.

Nowadays, it seems that the world is confused and
filled with chaos, disease, famine, war, hate, poverty, and


devilishment. In these days and time, the Devil is in full
control and we are living in physical hell. The world is
filled with lies and illusions. Billions of people are living
in illusion — they are mentally blind, deaf, and dumb.
Yet each possesses the qualifications to build or destroy.
Our thoughts are the governing, dominating power on
this planet. Each thought is like a bomb. It could either
save you or kill you. It has been said that words kill
faster than bullets. Yet both words and bullets are created
by thoughts. In fact, all you see around you comes from
the thoughts of people. So who can man blame for the
condition that the world is in besides man? Who can
change the world besides man?

As I look at this world, I see that it has become a place
of sexual perversion, violence, drug abuse, disease, etc.
Yet if we look at each of these things individually we can
see where they come from and who is causing them to
happen.

It can be shown and proven how one thought can
change the world for good or bad. If we look into the
first book of the Bible, Genesis, we see where negativity
started. First Eve eats of the forbidden fruit, so the first
sin is committed. Cain killed his brother Abel, so he was
the first murderer. Ham looked upon Noah while he
was naked — this became the first perversion of thought.
Canaan was cursed with disease, thus disease was born.
There are many more names and events in Genesis where
sin begins. Each unrighteous act took only one thought

from one man or one woman. Everyone else took on
these actions. They say that Eve was the first to sin and
from this all sin was derived. Genesis is the first book of
the Bible and Revelation is the last book. It took only one
sin and one thought to put the world into hell. So maybe
it would take only one thought to change all this. Just as
if the president expressed the thought of going to war,
we’d go to war, so it only takes one thought of peace to
bring peace. This one thought must be properly mani-
fested through the righteous will. So out of six billion
people, one man or woman may have that one thought
that may change the world. Yet in order to change the
world, one must first change oneself. As the popular song
goes look at the man in the mirror. Once man destroys
the Devil in himself, he will be able to conquer Hell.
There are many people who say that you can’t change the
way things are, but they are wrong. If God created
thoughts and the Devil duplicated thoughts, and both
have the ability to change the outcome of thoughts, God
thought to create a world of beauty while the Devil du-
plicated his thought by building his own world. God
thought to make a world of peace, while the Devil made
a world of war. Thus it is now up to man to change it
back. God and Devil both are only man. Man made
the world what it is, and only man can change it. So don’t
be deceived when they tell you that you can’t change
things, because you can. When you are hot, you jump
into the water to become cool. When you are wet, you lie


in the sun to become dry. That’s a minute example of the
power of change.

The first step is knowledge. You must know what
must be changed. And the only way to know this is by
looking at yourself and knowing yourself. A good man
will see the goodness in himself and the devilishment
in the world and so will attempt to change the world
to good. Yet in these days, everyone has some type of
devilish thoughts inside. So he must first change his
thoughts, then change the things that make him think in
that devilish way or avoid them. Then he should start
teaching people the right way to think. How can you tell
what is the right way? Simple. There is only one right way
and that is the truth. Although some may approach it
from different points on the cipher, they still arrive at the
same truth. For one plus one equals two anywhere in
the universe. In order for one to find God, he must first
look inside himself. Thoughts are the key to life, just as a
man thinks them. One thought can change the world. So,
brothers and sisters, don’t let the Devil tell you that you
can’t change things, because you can. The only thing
you can’t change is the truth, for the truth is that which
in times changes things back to their original state. Right
now we are living in illusions. Five billion people are liv-
ing in illusions. And out of all these people, only 5 per-
cent advocate the truth. They are the ones who will
produce the thoughts of a change. And out of this 5 per-
cent may come one person with the perfect solution. It
