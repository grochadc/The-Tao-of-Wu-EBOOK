ISLAND
A PARABLE OF SOLITUDE
I spent my formative years on an island — Staten Island — which is a blessing I’ve taken with me through life. Many cultures consider an island to be the ideal home. First, because you’re surrounded by water, which is life. Second, because you’re isolated from the masses, which allows you to find yourself, to develop inner strengths you couldn’t find anywhere else. An island shows you the true nature of life itself.
In Staten Island, Wu-Tang niggas were set apart from all the influences and fads that were happening in the other four boroughs. I believe that while everything else in hip-hop culture was in constant flux, this island was nurturing something ancient. When you watch a movie like Godzilla, you see them go out to one of these tiny remote islands and find Mothra. It was the same way with us. A nine-man hip-hop crew based on Mathematics, chess, comics, and kung-fu flicks wasn’t springing up in the middle of a Manhattan art scene. Only on a remote island can something like King Kong grow to his full capacity.
When I first bought a house out in New Jersey, I got it as a Wu house, but the rest of the members couldn’t stand being there — they wanted to be in the city. But for me this remote house, this island, was the best place to be. It’s a place to break off the antennas on top of buildings, to break away from those frequencies, to break away from everybody’s hustle and negativity. A place to reconnect with your own strength.
My kung-fu teacher Sifu would come out to this house to train me. My uncle, who was also a martial artist used to live and train there too. In fact, it was out in tins island that he developed a style he called the Universal African Fighting Style. Eventually, he ended up being Inducted into the Martial Arts Hall of Fame, all because he had developed something special — a combination of Jujitsu, karate, and samurai.
My uncle was inducted by Moses Powell, the jujitsu expert who founded the style known as Sanuces Ryu. Powell passed away recently, but he was one of the top black martial artists in the country. He trained CIA men, demonstrated for the United Nations, and taught warriors in many different fields. But when my uncle went to study with him, he told my uncle something important. He said, “What *you* got is unique.” He let him know that he was blessed, that he had it already within him.
I advise everyone to find an island in this life. Find a place where this culture can’t take energy from you, sap your will and originality. Since anything physical can be mental, that island can be your home. Turn off the electromagnetic waves being forced upon you, the countless invisible forces coming at you all the time.
