SECOND PILLAR OF WISDOM

KNOWLEDGE


On the corner of my block there stood this old man
A black immigrant from the land of Sudan
Who used to tell stories to the children in the building
But never had a dollar to keep his pocket filled in
He bombed, he knew Deuteronomy the science of astronomy
But didn’t know the basic principles of economy
I say the wise man don’t play the role of a fool
The first thing a man must obtain is Twelve Jewelz
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding to help you achieve
Freedom, Justice, Equality, Food, Clothing, and Shelter
After this, Love, Peace, and Happiness
He had the nappiest head, I told him total satisfaction
Is to achieve one goal in the scheme of things
He who works like a slave, eats like a king

— “Twelve Iewelz,” Gravediggaz




When I stayed down South, Uncle Hollis was my teacher. In the streets of New York, we taught each other. Cousins, hustlers, gangsters — they were all part of my extended family, and each one taught me something. For example, when I was nine my cousin Vince turned me on to kung-fu flicks. He’d take me to the Forty-second Street theaters in Manhattan, where they played triple features for $1.50. That’s where I first saw the Shaw Brothers’ The Five Deadly Venoms, a film that sparked a lifelong obsession. By the time The Empire Strikes Back came out, in 1979, everyone at school was talking about that. I’d be saying, “You seen Five Deadly Venoms" and no one knew what I was talking about.
But in 1980, another cousin hooked me up with some different wisdom, a kind they weren’t talking about in school. And for me, this wisdom changed the whole world.
All through 1978 and ’79, as I was living in Brownsville — writing rhymes, chasing hip-hop, digging kungfu flicks — I kept looking forward to trips down South. I was hoping to get more one-on-one time with Uncle Hollis, to learn from this man who was like a father to me. Then after about a year of life in Brooklyn, my great grandfather came over to bring me the news: Uncle Hollis passed away from a heart attack.
That was the probably the last time I cried until my moms died, decades later. I mean, like, cry, cry, cry, like how they cry in the Bible — wailing, gnashing teeth. It was the most painful experience of my life, and it secured my poverty. When Hollis passed there was no more connection to that family. Now my mother was four months behind in the rent, landlords were telling us to get out. We were about to lose our home — to go from next-to-nothing to nothing.
But right around that time, my cousin Daddy-O asked me something. He said, “Yo, you heard about those Twelve Jewels?”
I didn’t know what he meant. Daddy-O was a street hustler, a cool guy, not a spiritual man. But it turned out he was also a Muslim, someone whose other name, his righteous name, was Born Knowledge. He explained that these weren’t physical jewels, like someone in the hood wore to display his wealth. They were mental jewels — principles, ways of life — and that by obtaining them you would find a different kind of wealth. He said the Jewels were part of something called “the Lessons” — teachings from the Nation of Islam.
It would be a year or two before I heard about the Lessons or the Nation again. In fact, you’re not even supposed to learn the Twelve Jewels first, you’re supposed to learn them third — after the Supreme Mathematics and the Supreme Alphabet. But back then all I wanted to know about were those Jewels. And even today, the Jewels are the precepts I advocate most.
The Jewels are as follows: Knowledge, Wisdom, Understanding, Freedom, Justice, Equality Food, Clothing, Shelter, Love, Peace, and Happiness. Each jewel has its own profound meaning, and each one takes work and meditation to achieve, but they break down like a chain reaction.
First a man gets Knowledge, which is knowledge of self. Then he gets Wisdom, which is the reflection of that knowledge. Then he gets Understanding, which is the power to act on Wisdom. With Understanding he sees that he has Freedom that he has freed his dome from ignorance — which means he has free will. But Freedom operates under a law: the law of Justice. That means that I’m free to smack you in your face, but justice applies: There will be a reward or penalty for my actions. Therefore, I must deal with Equality, because all men are created equal. By showing Equality to one another we’re activating Freedom, Justice, and Equality — the fourth-through-sixth jewels.
Now, those are all things that build a man’s character. And after you attain them, you’re able to strive for Food, Clothing, and Shelter — which also have both physical and mental meanings. Obviously food is nourishment, shelter is a home, and clothing is protection. But mental food is food from the tree of life — wisdom, science, history, food for your mind. Mental clothing is how you
carry yourself — the way you walk, the way you move and speak. If you have clothed yourself in righteousness, even the bummiest clothing has dignity. And mental shelter is the mind’s protection from the evil atmosphere — the lies and corruption of the outside world. So if you have these three jewels, your home is like a king’s even if you’re living in a shack.
Soon enough, that’s exactly how I was living. Right after Daddy-O told me about the Jewels, my family was kicked out of our home. My two brothers and I wound up in with our grandparents on 64 Targee Street in Staten Island. There the only mathematics being practiced was addition. First we were five. Then my aunt and her husband came back from the army and moved in with their daughter. We were eight. A month later, my uncle, his wife, and his daughter moved in from Minnesota. We were eleven. Then my other uncle, who was gay, popped up with his friend — another gay dude who dressed like a woman — and they moved in. We were thirteen. This kept up until I counted nineteen people living in a two bedroom. Your bed was whatever spot you could grab on the floor. Your blankets were those gray wool mats that movers use to protect furniture.
That’s poverty in this country — something that makes you small, shrinks your horizon, clouds your vision. But even when I was living like that, because of what DaddyO told me, I had faith that my mind could transform my surroundings. Mathematics would form my first governing principles, but the Jewels had the biggest impact on me. And that’s probably because of when they found me right when everything else was being taken away.
With the idea of the Jewels, I got a sense that even if my body was in hell, my mind wasn’t. Most people let their body lead their mind. When someone has a drug addiction, his body is addicted to the drug. Heroin is a physical addiction: If you don’t get it, you get sick. But even though your body is addicted, your mind chastises you every time you use it. When your mind has attained these Jewels, it leads the body. So even if you’re in a physical hell, by seeking the Twelve Jewels you let your mind lead your body to Heaven.
You don t get all Twelve Jewels at once — -you have to strive for them, prepare yourself for them. But after you attain the first nine, then you’re ready to make your life truly satisfying. That’s when you can attain Love, which is the highest elevation of Understanding — either between two people or between all members of mankind. And after you attain Love, then you have Peace, and finally you get Happiness — which is total and complete satisfaction with yourself. This means you realize that nothing and nobody else can make you happy. Happiness is something you get from yourself. If you’re completely satisfied with yourself, nobody can take it away from you.
Years later, I realized that this principle, the last of the Twelve Jewels, applies to everyone, everywhere in the world. Two decades after my time on Targee Street, I went to West Africa — as a rich and famous man. I went to visit my cousin and Wu-Tang brother Ghostface, who had gone to get treated for diabetes by a bush doctor that his herbalist in Staten Island recommended. The doctor’s village was deep in the country of Benin — hours from any city, a place with no running water, where people lived in mud huts and slept on the floor. At this point, I’d lived in the Trump Plaza, in a million-dollar home; I’d been hanging with millionaires and even billionaires. I came to Benin having just stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel in London, at the Grand Hyatt in France, and in the London home of Richard Branson, the mogul who founded Virgin. I came to West Africa from the height of wealth and was blessed with a new understanding of poverty.
The first place you reach from the airport is Cotonou, a crowded city of about a million people. Everyone there lives in apartment buildings and strives for a Western lifestyle. But when Ghost came in to meet me there, he’d been in the village awhile. He was wearing an African dashiki, his hair had grown out, and he had a full beard: He looked like an African villager. Everybody on the street was dismissive of Ghost. But everyone was being cool with me — trying to shake my hand and be my friend — because I was dressed in hip-hop clothes. They thought I was somebody and Ghost was nobody. They were trying to be like Americans.
I got into this beat-up Peugeot with Ghost and the bush doctor’s right-hand man, and we headed out to the village. When we got there, I noticed something else. In the city, just about everyone I met had his hand out — either asking for something or trying to sell me something. When we got to the village, everyone had his hand out in offering — either something to eat, or directions, or some kind of help. They had less but they were offering more.
I had brought some kung-fu flicks with me because Ghost was jonesing and the bush doctor was into kung fu. So we sat in a hut before the one TV in the village and watched Blade of Fury — a great movie, about a revolution where all the revolutionaries get killed but one kid survives and the master is still happy because he realizes that the revolution will be carried on. As we watched, all the kids in the village stood outside and watched through the window while we, the honored guests, sat inside.
Years before, when we were living in the Park Hill projects in Staten Island, we’d always wonder why the Africans moving in seemed so happy. They were crammed into a room just like us but they were happy. They liked the projects. We hated the projects. The projects are the worst place you can be if you’re watching TV, reading magazines, seeing people who have jobs and live in houses. We didn’t understand the gangbangers in California. I’d always complain, “They flippin’ this set and that set and these motherfuckers got houses. We’ve got to live where you got two niggas on top of you, two niggas beside you, and neighbors that you hear moving around you at all times!”
But in Africa, I saw these people living on dirt. They had nothing but food, clothing, and shelter — and a love of themselves. And so they had happiness, the Twelfth Jewel. It’s within all of us. Western culture just makes it harder to find.
Of course, back when I was a kid, I wasn’t looking too hard.
A year after Hollis died and Daddy-O told me about the Twelve Jewels, I had settled into life in the hood. Mad changes happen at that age, and by 1980 I was a street kid, a hip-hop fiend. I hated school and waited for each weekend, when I’d hang out with my cousin Gary, who would become the GZA, or my other cousin Russell, who would become Ol' Dirty Bastard. Sugar Hill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight” came out the year before and showed us you could make a record with rhymes, so I wrote at least twenty songs that year, setting them to my mom’s R&B records.
Gary was a couple of years older and the guy who introduced me to hip-hop, so naturally I looked up to him. And one spring day, that respect opened a door to enlightenment. You could say hip-hop was the vessel, but the message was Allah.
At the time, I was staying at 64 Targee Street, right by the Stapleton projects. Gary lived at 55 Bowing Street, in the Park Hill projects — one of the toughest in New York. To get there I could either walk a straight line down the street outside the projects, or I could go to the store, through Stapleton, and then through Park Hill. For some reason, I was the kind of kid who’d walk through two projects to get where I was going.
I’d go to the store first— a little corner Puerto Rican bodega— and I’d ask the hot dog guy, Mr. Harry, for food. I'd say, Mr. Harry, I don’t got no money, can I have a donut?” And he’d give me a donut, maybe give me a hot dog. Then, I’d head into the projects.
Everything was there: the music, the people, the sound, the color— the place was alive. They had block parties going on all the time then— DJ Jones, Dr. Rock and the Force M.D.s all playing in the park or on the plaza. So this one beautiful day in May, I came into those projects for hip-hop — to hear the music in the street and write rhymes with Gary. But I went home with something even deeper.
The minute I showed up, something about Gary was different. For one thing, he had a different name. We always used to call him by his government name, Gary, his nickname, Buck, or his rapper name, Gangsta G. But this day he said, “My name is Allah Justice.” Then he told me about Knowledge: the first chamber of study in the Nation of Gods and Earths.
He said, “Yo, Knowledge is the basic foundation of all life. And I was like, “Whatchu mean?” We were standing outside his building, a block away from where I heard that
first hip-hop party four years earlier. But for some reason, what GZA started saying and the way he said it hit me even harder than the MCs I’d heard that night.
He told me about Mathematics and Knowledge of Self and God. “He’s not a spirit,” GZA said. “God is you; he’s inside you.” Then he showed me a white sheet of paper. On the top were bold letters that read, “All Praise Is Due to Allah, Lord of All the World.” It was the first page from the Divine Lessons, from the Nation of Gods and Earths.
The Gods were the next generation of the Nation of Islam, whose teachings had shaped giants like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali. The newer school was founded in 1964, by a Harlem student minister known as Clarence 13X, who we now call the Father. He was looking for a quicker and more powerful way to bring those teachings directly to America’s black youth, so he condensed the Nation’s Lost-Found Lessons into a philosophical core called the 120, which formed the basis of the Lessons taught by the Five Percent Nation in New York — lessons that had transformed my cousin Gary into Allah Justice.
After we finished talking, Allah Justice gave me that first page of Lessons to read on my own. At this point, I was miles from Uncle Hollis and his books. No one else I respected was telling me to get an education, but GZA did. He told me to educate myself, to seek knowledge on my own. We talked for a bit more, then I headed home in a kind of trance.
All the way home, about a mile-long walk, I kept hearing in my mind, “God, God, God.” I walked past a fish and chips place with a pinball machine ringing inside. “God, God, God ...” I walked past a Chinese restaurant, past a pizzeria. "God, God, God ...” I walked down Targee by the Stapleton projects, which loomed like the Death Star. “God, God, God. . . .” Then I passed a Christian church.
In the streets, spiritual messages come in pamphlets. As I went by this church, a dude out front handed me one. It said The Bread of Life.” I took it and kept walking.
When I got home I memorized that sheet of Mathematics quickly, but I was still hungry for Knowledge. So I memorized the Christian pamphlet’s teaching about the Gospel of John. I’d heard Bible stories my whole life, but now that I had this personalized idea of Knowledge in my head, it made the lessons of the Bible seem stronger. This time I understood how to read the Bible, how to look at it for what’s real in my heart instead of what somebody’s telling me. That night, I started reading the Bible. And kept reading until I finished it.
The ancient Chinese philosopher Meng-tzu wrote, “Truth out of season bears no fruit.” To me, that means two things. One: There’s a time and place for every kind of knowledge to flourish. Two: The personal characteristics of great messengers are usually irrelevant. For instance, they say that Martin Luther King Jr. was a fornicator. Does it matter? Do you believe in the messenger or his message? I believe in the message. That’s why when I read certain books or see certain films, I skip over the names: Forget who said it if it’s truth. For some reason, I’ve always felt that way, that knowledge is like God, out I here behind labels and images. Eastern thought, Christianity, comic books, kung fu: They all have truths, and each truth has a season — either in history or in your own life. And in the spring season of 1980, I was blessed with the truth of Divine Mathematics, through my cousin and enlightener, GZA.
The next day, after I stayed up all night reading the Bible, I went back to him and started quoting back to him what I learned from the pamphlet and that first set of Lessons. He was impressed with that, and he gave me the next set. It was time for me to find Knowledge, but that meant that first I had to find Knowledge of Self.
This is one kind of knowledge you can’t seek. It’s something you have to let happen to you — through meditation, sitting quiet and alone, in contemplation. In the early ’80s, when you came to Mathematics, you had to fast for three days before they gave you the Knowledge and began your training. It was like the test they give a Shaolin novice, to see if he’s centered and committed. I did it when I was eleven.
After I officially began my studies of the Lessons, GZA gave me the rest of the Divine Mathematics and the Divine Alphabet. Then I had to choose a name. He told me to think of my own name. I thought for a long time and came up with Rakeem. He approved because he could call me “Ra” and my moms would think he was saying “Rob.”
This was important — parents were kicking kids out for taking names, getting Lessons.
The Five Percent had a reputation as a gang, as vicious, terrifying criminals. Even when I first heard GZA talking about the Five Percent, my first thought was, Hold on, ain't those the guys that beat up my uncle last year?The rep came because a lot of them were tough niggas from jail who never really let those ways go, who weren’t living the Lessons righteously— or were doing it imperfectly, let’s say. They hadn’t let go of their negative side. Turns out, neither had I.
I started studying the Lessons with my brother, Universal King. I loved the shit out of King, but he was a bully big brother. Today I realize that he made us all into warriors, but he did so much violence to us growing up that I didn't like him. So it was good to have something to build love between us, but it only went so far. At a certain point, my frustration with him came between me and righteousness. One day, we had a fight and I lost, as usual, and after this fight, I told him, “Fuck you! I ain’t righteous no more!” And I ate a pork chop on him — smothered in gravy, on a bed of rice. I figured that was the only way to hurt him. When I did that, I stopped reading the Lessons. I stopped believing out of anger.
But a year or so later, I was sitting down at the table at my grandmother’s house, and my aunt’s boyfriend was over. He was a heroin addict and clearly fucked up: nappy head, scraggly beard — he looked kind of like a wino Jesus — and he kept nodding off. My grandmother was making some food and asked him, “You want some hot dogs, Donald?” And he said, “There better not be any pork in it.” When I heard him say that — just mumbling in a kind of daze — it spoke to me. Then he looked at me and said, “The Lessons are right; the Gods are right.” When he finished talking he got up and left, and my heart opened again.
In a way, this doped-up, nappy-headed junkie was like an angel. He wasn’t living the Lessons anymore and it showed. What my heart heard from him was, “Those lessons will save your life.” I was twelve years old. That night got me back into it.
The point is, sometimes you have to be called more than once. The angel called the Prophet Muhammad saying, “Read.” Muhammad was illiterate and said, “I can’t read.” “Read,” the angel said again. “I can’t read,” Muhammad said. Then the angel said: “In the name of Allah who created man from a drop of blood — READ.” And it was the third time that he felt it.
My first call came from Daddy-O telling me about the Twelve Jewels. 1 heard it but didn’t follow. The second came from GZA, who enlightened me, started me on the path, but I drifted out of anger. The third came from a dope fiend, a man who once had Knowledge of Self but lost it, fell away into darkness. His call was the same as the other ones, but he was a living example of what happens when you stray.
After that, I dove back into the lessons, mastered them in seven months. I didn’t tell anybody. I fasted by myself. I studied only in the bathroom. And when I finally got up to the l-to-14, the level my brother was at, a level good enough to be a man with it and really understand it, I told him. We were brothers again — but in a deeper way than before. The third call was my final call. I was convinced. And once I mastered these lessons, I was able to understand every step of my life.
The Lessons begin with the 120. That’s 120 lessons or degrees that help you understand man’s relationship to the universe. I learned the 120 faster than anyone else in my neighborhood and had them down by the time I was twelve years old. But it was only later that I realized just how deep they really were, how the wisdom of Mathematics connected to the jewels of Eastern, Western, scientific, and religious thought— and to the knowledge I already had in my heart. That’s because Mathematics is also what Euclid said it is: a description of the thoughts of God. And the only way to get to God is to find him within yourself.
But in Mathematics, the method of instruction has a
power of its own. When the Father brought these lessons to lost and confused young black men like me, he was promising a transformation that the lessons actually provide. That fact is, if you get through the rigors of study with the Gods, you truly are a different person.
The 120 breaks down to 120 questions and answers. The first few, called the l-to-10, are ten questions that begin with “Who is the original man?” The answer is: “The original man is the Asiatic Black man, the Maker, the Owner, the Cream of the planet Earth, the Father of Civilization, and God of the Universe.” You have to memorize each question and answer verbatim, with every single article, noun, and verb correct. After the l-to-10 comes the 1 -to-36 — which are thirty-six phrases. When I was learning them, I’d say, “My name is Prince Rakeem, I came to North America by myself. My uncle was brought over here by a trader three hundred and seventy-nine years ago. My uncle does not know he’s my uncle. He doesn’t speak his own language.” The phrases go on and on.
After mastering these, you move on to the l-to-14, which are more intense. By this time, the answers are pages long. If you get through them, you’ve memorized thousands and thousands of words, in precise order. The main lesson people tend to get stuck on is the Fourth, or Culture, Degree, from the l-to-14. That’s the one that deals with a man named Yacub, whose biblical name would be Jacob, father of the white race. What hangs students up here isn’t the idea that the white race was a diabolical experiment- — any poor, black kid feels that 38 way at some point in his life — it’s the length of the question and precision of the phrasing. The question reads: "Why do we run Yacub and his made Devil from the roots of civilization over the hot Arabian desert into the caves of West Asia as they now called Europe? What is the meaning of E.U. and Rope? How long ago was it? What did the Devil bring with him? What kind of life did the Devil live then? How long was it before Musa came to teach the Devil their forgotten trick knowledge?” That’s just the question. Now just imagine how long the answer is. The Born Degree, which comes after, is even longer.
To a lot of guys in the ghetto, this was their education. I knew brothers who only graduated fifth grade yet were scientists because of the Lessons. They learned geology, geometry, astronomy, physics, history — all of it came through the Lessons. What is the circumference of the Earth? “The circumference of the planet Earth is approximately 25,000 miles.” What is the diameter of the Earth? “The diameter of the Earth is 7,926 miles.” The total square miles of the Earth — total square miles of land, total square miles of water. The weight of the planet. The speed of light, the speed of sound. You learned more than you would in school.
The Lessons are a map to realization — they lead you to it in steps. The first step, or degree, is Knowledge. We
refer to the first task in any situation as “doing the knowledge,” which means to look, listen, and observe. But the power of the Lessons didn’t just come from the information they provided; it also came from their actual vocabulary and the cadence. It’s like how they say that the Koran can be truly understood only in Arabic, because of the cadence of the language. The act of internalizing these Lessons transforms you; it strengthens your mind.
A few years ago, some British researchers did a study on cab drivers in London. They scanned their brains and found that the ones who had the most time on the streets had the largest hippocampi — which is the part of the brain that handles memory. By mastering the streets in that city, they actually increased the size and changed the structure of their brains. In order to get qualified, each cab driver had to go through a training period in which they mastered all the geography in the city. What do they call this? Doing the knowledge.
See, I believe the Lessons provide something that everyone, of any race, needs: a sense of perspective — of the size of the world, the scale of the universe, the place of man. The Earth has only 57,250,000 square miles of land on it. And out of that, only 29 million is useful. This kind of information grounds you, shrinks your problems and expands your horizons at the same time. You can hear its wisdom in a verse by one of the greatest rappers of all time, Rakim: “What would you say as the Earth gets further and further away / Planets as small as balls of clay / Stray into the Milky Way, world’s out of sight / As far as the eye can see, not even a satellite.” That’s a mind transformed by the Lessons.
Mathematics contains universal truths, but no one needed its wisdom more than poor black men at the end of the last century. So many of us were so lost — deprived of knowledge of self, of others, of the world we lived in. Even in the Islamic world, commentaries on Muslim books were teaching that the black man comes from the grandson of Noah, who was Ham — a man who was cursed, made to be despised, a servant, a slave. That’s a myth, but it was a myth taught in both mosques and Christian churches, a myth taught to the slaves as well.
If you were poor and black, Mathematics attacked the idea that you were meant to be ignorant, uneducated, blind to the world around you. It exposed the lies that helped people treat your forefathers as animals. And it wasn’t until someone like the Father came to actively disseminate this information to poor black men — saying, “Hold on, your people are the fathers of civilization” — that people like me were set free. I can now say that if it wasn’t for Mathematics, I wouldn’t have achieved anything. I never would have imagined that a poor black motherfucker like me would grow up to respect the world, his fellow man, or himself.
The same thing happened to Malcolm X — he’s in jail,
going through hell, and a man comes and tells him, “You ain’t no nigger. You’re from the tribe of Shabbaz.” And light then, all his self-hatred turned to ashes. He heard I he call and from every day on he was alive.
That’s what the Lessons did for me. They gave me guidance, understanding, and freedom.
But freedom from yourself? That’s often a whole different story.
