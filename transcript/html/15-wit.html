    <title>WIT: A PRISOM PARABLE OF VERBAL KUNG FU</title>

    <h2>WIT</h2>
    <h3>A PRISON PARABLE OF VERBAL KUNG FU</h3>
    <p>The first word in one of Wu-Tang’s acronyms is witty: Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game. That’s because wit is a form of wisdom, a form that deflects and absorbs, a kind that can save your life. I learned this lesson during a card game in jail.</p>
    <p>We were playing spades, and in jail spades is a very serious game. You deal thirteen cards to each player, and each team tries to win the most “books.” You and your partner use strategy and give subtle hints to each other, so it actually gets mad complex and psychological for such a simple game. On top of that, in prison you play for prison stakes — cigarettes, food, whatever — so the stakes are higher than they are outside.</p>
    <p>In this one game, me and my partner were playing Iwo other guys for our breakfast. I was probably about three days in, eighteen or nineteen years old — young, skinny, and new. My partner, Mike, was a muscular giant who had been in for a while. He was the kind of nigga  M you did not want to fuck with — everyone was afraid of Big Mike.</p>
    <p>At first, Big Mike and I were playing and communicating with each other well. I’m a good player, and we were doing some work on these other guys; we were busting some ass. But I made a crucial mistake because 1 didn't know my partner well enough. In a way I lacked the wisdom for this particular game. Our bet was two-for-ten, which is a do-or-die bet. If you make it, you win the game, if you miss, you lose the game — all in a single hand.</p>
    <p>Mike threw me a signal that I didn't read. And this one time — on the game-winning hand — I blew it. My mistake led to us losing our hand, our game, and our breakfast. This was bad.</p>
    <p>Mike jumped up and got like an animal. “Motherfucking Slim, why the fuck didn’t you play the diamonds?” He came at me and — boom — it was about to be me and him.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know what to do — I almost came with the violence back at him. But instead of bringing it, I thought of kung fu. I got loud and flipped it.</p>
    <p>I yelled, “Man, fuck them bitchass niggas, Mike. We gon’ get those niggas next time!”</p>
    <p>In a second, I deflected the beef to the other guys who beat us and reestablished myself as being on Mike's side. We both lost, we both were going to go hungry, and Mike wanted to put hands on me — but I deflected it.</p>
    <p>And it worked. Suddenly, Mike chimed in. “Yeah! fuck y’all bitchass niggas, we gon’ get y all niggas next time.” And he gave me a pound. It was a close call. I was saved by wit and wisdom.</p>
    <p>It’s like Bruce Lee said: I practice the art of fighting without fighting.” He also said, “You don't have to fight the giant every time.”</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>    Practice wit and deflection</p>
    <p>    everyday. You never know</p>
    <p>    when you'll need it.</p>
