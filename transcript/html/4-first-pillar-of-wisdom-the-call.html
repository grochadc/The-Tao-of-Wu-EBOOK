<h2>FIRST PILLAR OF WISDOM</h2>
<h3>THE CALL</h3>

<p>From the heart of Medina</p>

<p>to the head of Fort Greene</p>

<p>Now-Y-C: Now I See Everything</p>

<p>- — RZA, “N.Y.C. Everything”</p>

<p>Let the caller and the called disappear;</p>

<p>be lost in the call.</p>

<p>- - RUMI</p>


<p>In every story and life, there’s a call. In the Book of Exodus, it comes to Moses after he leaves Egypt as a shepherd: One of his sheep gets away, he goes looking for it on a mountain, and he hears a voice — God calling to him. In the Koran, it comes to Muhammad after he’s had kids and has lived a full, righteous life: He’s forty years old and meditating in a cave, and he hears a voice — Allah calling him to be a prophet. Or look at San Te, in the film Thirty-sixth Chamber: He’s out in the countryside rebelling against the Manchu government and sees a dude break a box of fish open with his bare hands. He asks him, “How’d you do that?’ and the guy says, “It’s kung fu; I learned it at Shaolin.” That one word, Shaolin, was a call to San Te — what sent him to seek knowledge, become a monk, and spread the wisdom of kung fu around the world.</p>
<p>I believe the call can come to anyone, at any time. I know because it came to me, one night in a Staten Island housing project, in July of 1976.</p>

<p>I was born Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to one of the biggest families in New York. My mother had eleven kids, so she’s responsible for thirty-five, forty people. My great-uncle had eight children — one of whom would become Ol' Dirty Bastard — so that sprouted another forty, fifty people, and it goes on from there. Through marriage and bloodline, we spread across all five boroughs. Part of the reason is we were scattered from the beginning.</p>
<p>My family broke up when I was three years old. In my last memory of my father, he’s holding me in one hand and a hammer in the other, smashing up the furniture. Since my mother couldn’t afford to raise the five of us herself, she sent us away, and I went off to live with her father’s family in North Carolina. That’s where I got to know my uncle Hollis, the first wise man in my life.</p>
<p>Hollis had that Solomon kind of wisdom. He was a doctor, a wealthy man with hundreds of acres of land, many adopted children, and a joy of life that followed him everywhere. He was the kind of man you’d have to call enlightened. Every one of my mom’s brothers and sisters had a different father, and her father’s family didn’t like my grandmother, who had my moms when she was sixteen. But Hollis had love for his brother’s daughter. He was always checking up on her, trying to put her in school — although she never went, and just kept having kids instead. But Hollis had a compulsion to lake care of these kids, especially me.</p>

<p>As soon as I got down to North Carolina, Hollis started teaching me things, setting aside books for me to read, saying, “Bobby, I want you to study.” Before I turned four, I was doing my older brother’s homework. From Hollis I learned about science and religion, but also poetry and spoken word. One of the first books he gave me was a colection of Mother Goose rhymes — which I started memorizing immediately — and he was always going around saying these strange verses.</p>
<p>“Never cry when a hearse goes by,” he’d say. “Because you may be the next to die. They’ll cover you with a cold white sheet. They’ll put you down about six feet deep. It’s not so bad the first few weeks, until you start to mumble mid creep, and the worms crawl in and the worms crawl out and the ants play pinochle on your snout, your stomach turns the sickest green as pus runs out like thick whipped cream . . .” It was an old Southern folk rhyme — one of many Hollis used to say — and before long I started saying it myself.</p>

<p>Hollis also took us to church every Sunday. It was an old Southern Baptist church where the services bugged me out. I loved the Bible stories I was reading, but I didn’t like this room where people were falling out, catching the Holy Ghost, slobbering all over the place. That happened in a lot of black churches, and I could immediately see it was phony. The screaming and moaning just didn’t feel right. The spirit of God sounded beautiful to me, but I quickly separated the experience of God from church. I just couldn’t see God in the fake-ass preachers or people wallowing on the ground. But I could see him in Hollis, my first real teacher.</p>
<p>Then, when I was seven, my mother called us back to New York. Eight of us moved in with her at Marcus Garvey projects in Brooklyn. There, a different kind of education began.</p>
<p>Our place was on Dumont Avenue, right across the street from Betsy Head Pool — a vicious, violent place, the kind you definitely weren’t coming back from with your sneakers. Kids from Brownsville projects, Tilden projects, Van Dyke projects, and Marcus Garvey used to hang out there, and two guys named Bighead Mike hung at the basketball court next door. One was Mike Tyson, the other was a drug dealer who later shot up our stoop trying to get a rival dealer (who happened to be my friend Chili Wop).</p>
<p>My second night living there, I got jacked at the store by three teenagers. When I got home, my mother asked me what happened. When I told her, she grabbed me and a butcher’s knife and, still in her nightgown, walked me back lo the store, looking for these motherfuckers. That was when I got a sense of the family with me now.</p>
<p>But the fact is, at this point I was a nerd: deep into books, saying “Yes, sir, no, ma’am,” going to church every Sunday. I may have been staying in the hood, but I was living in my head. That changed in the summer of 1976.</p>
<p>Something was happening in New York that year. There was a force in the air that didn’t have a name yet. And this one afternoon, it was alive at a block party in the Park Hill projects in Staten Island. I had come by to visit my cousin Gary, who would become the GZA. There, between the two buildings where kids played stickball, some DJs had plugged their systems into the lights. I remember walking in, hearing the sound, feeling the energy, and getting, sucked in.</p>
<p>It was DJ Jones, and the MCs were MC Punch and Quincy. They were on the mike saying just a couple of very simple rhymes, the same two or three lines all night long. That was rap way back then — just one or two phrases repeated. Like a mantra. And when I heard that beat and those rhymes, I felt a euphoria I can’t even explain. I ended up staying there through the night, not getting back to the house until eleven o’clock and getting an ass whupping from my mother.</p>
<p>Because in that parking lot, I heard the love of my life  calling to me.</p>
<p>The night was cooling off; I was dancing with a girl — me just eight years old and doing the wop, grinding up on her, freaking her. Then I heard one of those MCs.</p>
<p>Back then, songs were sung. Instruments were played. This was the voice of a man speaking words over music. It sounds crazy now — I’ve written thousands and thousands of lyrics since then, even lyrics jumping off Hollis’s folk rhymes with the group Gravediggaz, on an album called Six Feet Deep. But that night, these were the first words I heard spoken over a beat. It’s like it says in the Gospel of John: “In the beginning was the Word.” And to me, those words weren’t just rap lyrics. They spoke to something inherent in me. If you ask my older brother, he’ll tell you I was reading Dr. Seuss in rhyme and rhythm at age three. But up until that night, I’d been living in my head. These words and this music, they were a call — a call to something deep inside me. They were a call to my soul. And it came in a simple party rap, a few lines that went on through the night.</p>

<p>Dip-dip, dive</p>
<p>So-so-cialize</p>
<p>Clean out your ears</p>
<p>Open your eyes</p>


<p>Open your mind, body, and soul</p>

<p>to God’s voice in whatever</p>
<p>vessel that bears it. Let it pull</p>
<p>you into the world.</p>
