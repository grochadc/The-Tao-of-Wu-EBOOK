 <h2>HEART</h2>
 <h3>A STREET PARABLE OF COURAGE</h3>
 <p>When someone is known to be strong in the streets they say, “That nigga got a lot of heart.” It doesn’t mean he’s the toughest dude out there. It just means he has the will and the courage to do something difficult, even if it’s just surviving. If he got beat down, he came back up: He got a lot of heart.</p>
 <p>But another way of putting that is to say that his soul is large. This relates to the Heart Sutra, one of the shortest but most important sutras in all Buddhist writings. Its from the sutras known as the Perfection of Wisdom and it’s only a paragraph long, but you might look at it like the illest rap verse ever spit — simple, tight, and incomparably profound.</p>
 <p>Mostly the Heart Sutra is about being able to see reality as it truly is, unclouded by the things human beings project onto it. You read it differently in different translations, but to me, it’s about knowing yourself. It’s about trusting your heart— real heart, not your ego— to show you the truth. It’s about that spark of God inside you. It s a lesson that I learned many years ago, when I was a kid in Staten Island.</p>
 <p>When I was thirteen, the toughest guy in my age bracket was a guy they called June-June. June-June matured early— physically he was a man by the eighth grade— and he was also a knockout artist, a bad dude  no one wanted to fuck with.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for me, one of the few dudes that did fight him was my older brother Divine, who beat him.</p>
 <p>So when I met June-June a year later in junior high, we had an automatic beef-a sins-of-the-fathers situation.</p>
 <p>June-June wanted to try me.</p>
 <p>In seventh grade, I was one of those dudes who was always going to go for it. Win or lose, I’m going for it every time. So we had a fight, and I have to say he beat me. Put it this way. When you gotta bite a nigga to get up? That means you lost.</p>
 <p>I wound up moving to Brooklyn for a year or two and then moved back to Staten Island for high school. And in my first week back in the school, who do I run into? June-June. He was even still with his same little homeboy he’d been hanging with two years ago— a little instigating motherfucker. This little dude said to June-June, “Remember him? Remember him? He’s that nigga that bit you that one time.” So June-June came up to me and was like, “What up, boy.”</p>
 <p>By this time, I was fourteen and had knowledge of myself. And if a man truly knows himself, he also knows 66 his enemy. He knows that even if his enemy is a giant, that giant still has the same weaknesses within him. I think that’s why the yin and yang has two dots, one on each side. The dot in your opposite — in this case the bully — is his weak spot. The more knowledge of self you have, the better chance you have of finding that little dot within him. Because that dot is the you in him. It’s like Jesus says in the Bible: “How is it that you can see the mote in your brother’s eye and not see the beam in your own?” The giant is bullying you for no reason other than that he sees something in you that he sees in himself.</p>
 <p>On some level, I perceived that within Infinite. So when he challenged me, I came back at him, saying, “I ain’t no boy, man.” His calling me that meant we had to fight. Again.</p>
 <p>This time it happened in McKee Park on Staten Island, between the two high schools, McKee and Curtis. (In a way, they’re Wu-Tang feeder schools. U-God went to McKee; I went to Curtis.) June- June and I walked four blocks to go fight in McKee Park, with a crowd following us.</p>
 <p>This time we must’ve fought for an hour. Nobody wins a fight like that. Even though we were only in ninth grade, this was a real fight between two men. There were blood, cuts, the kinds of wounds that don’t heal. It ended with him having two rocks in his hands — not a fair fight, if it ever was — and me still not backing down. The fight was over when neither of us could move.</p>
 <p>In this case, you would say that we both had heart. I had heart for defending my honor, because in the streets that’s all you have. I couldn’t beat this guy— he was probably lifting two hundred pounds by this time — but he could not beat me without killing me. I showed heart. And in this case, I showed enough heart that June-June wound up becoming my student. Soon after this, he found Mathematics, took the name Infinite, and began to study with me. I like to think that my heart wanted his respect so I could teach him. That’s the good side of heart.</p>
 <p>But there’s a dark side to heart, and that’s ego. That part of heart ended up defeating Infinite.</p>
 <p>In a year or two, Infinite became known throughout Staten Island as a tough dude and an egomaniac. A lot of guys that hung with me from Park Hill and Stapleton didn’t like him. Infinite was from New Brighton, and a lot of neighborhood wars were started by him and his brother. Mathematics had calmed him down a bit, but he was still knocking niggas out left and right.</p>
 <p>You had to say that Infinite had too much of the wrong kind of heart. It got to the point that he was confronted with a life-and-death situation, and ego destroyed him just like it can destroy all of us.</p>
 <p>In the kung-fu movie The Five Deadly Venoms, there’s a character named Golden Arms, who was also called the Toad, the fifth deadly venom. His style was simply to be invincible. No type of attack, not even blades or spears, could defeat him. You see a lot of Golden Arms kids in the hood — the place brings it out of you — and that’s definitely how June-June thought of himself. He was like Golden Arms: “I don’t need a weapon!”</p>
 <p>Infinite beat many men like that.</p>
 <p>But eventually he was defeated by a lesser man. That’s because he’d already defeated himself. This was a man with one of the biggest hearts in all of Staten Island, but one day he challenged this young nigga with the heart of a coward. He dared this kid to shoot him, and he did. Infinite died. Even the kid who killed him was like, “Yo, I didn’t want to kill him. He made me.” I believe that. I believe it was Infinite’s heart that killed him.</p>
 <p>They say there’s a dark spot in your heart, a tiny black vacuum, that’s the size of the tip of a needle. I believe that tiny space is where God is located inside you. That tiny dark spot is a piece of space trapped in our body, something that connects us to the universe and one another. Physics says that nature abhors a vacuum. Whether it’s true wisdom or ego, something is going to fill that vacuum in your heart. You’ll find out what it is as you go through life.</p>
 <p>If you’re a young man and have a lot of heart, that means you have courage. But then you learn the other meaning of heart, which is love.</p>
 <p>At first, love is a vacuum that takes courage from your heart. You’re scared around a woman you love. You’re not the same tough dude, the same thug. At first, love weakens you. But soon it makes you strong in ways you couldn’t imagine.</p>
 <p>Love is the first two steps, Knowledge and Wisdom, coming together. It’s 1 and 2 — put them together you get 1 2, and the twelfth letter in the alphabet is L, which stands for Love. If wisdom is like water, so is love. It dissolves you then rebuilds you stronger. It’s like when you have your first child — you’ve never felt weaker in your life. Your love for that child makes you vulnerable. But it also makes you stronger, because you’ll do anything to protect that child. So love, like wisdom, dissolves you and then resolves you. It breaks down your ego and puts you back together again properly.</p>
 <p>When love doesn’t find its way into your heart, you die. That’s what happened with Infinite. His fate was settled by Justice. The tenth letter of the English alphabet is J, and J represents Justice, which breaks down to Just I Ce (or “See”) Equality. That means that your reward or penalty after being given Knowledge depends on your way of using it, on how much Wisdom drives your decisions. The universe will show you whether your ego is at the steering wheel or you’re using your talent the way God wants you to. It’s going to come to light. No matter how much heart you got, it’s love you need to survive.</p>
