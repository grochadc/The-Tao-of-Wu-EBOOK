CHESS LESSONS
When I was eleven years old, three major changes hit me: 1) I found Knowledge of Self; 2) I lost my virginity; 3) I learned to play chess. The last two were actually with the same person — an older girl in the neighborhood — but then again we call women “wisdom,” so maybe it was meant to be. Chess became a source of wisdom that has been with me my whole life.
The game began centuries ago in India. In a way, it’s metaphysics as a board game. The board’s number of squares is sixty- four, which is a crucial number in Mathematics. Sixty-four is also the number of creation. When the sperm meets the egg and they have meiosis, it splits into sixty-four separate cells — two to four, four to eight, then eight to sixty-four: the basic number of life. When people say “Chess is life,” they may not even know how much truth they’re speaking.
Chess is also a martial art. It’s about combat and directing chi. When you’re on a streak in chess, you’re usually on a streak in everything in your life. You’re in balance, you’re pushing energy forth, you’re an unbeatable warrior. I know that happens with me. If I’m on point in my life, you better not test me on the chessboard. You’ll lose.
I used to play older men in Wall Street around the same time that Josh Waitzkin — the child chess prodigy who inspired the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer — was whupping older dudes’ asses in Washington Square Park. I'm a fan of Bobby Fischer and a fan of Josh, who’s now a friend. Years after he was the world chess champion for his age group, he went on to become a martial arts champ, and he says that chess revealed the learning ability that would allow him to dominate Tai Chi Chuan. Chess will do that. Even the simplest game teaches you something.
Probably the simplest game of all is the one called I tool’s Mate. It’s checkmate in four moves, but it takes no talent. If white moves first and goes to F4, black leaves his queen free with a move like E6 — just moving his pawn once. His queen is then free to go to H5. If black goes to (13, white goes to H5 and there’s no way to block an attack on the king. If you beat someone with this strategy, they’re not a worthy opponent. If you win with this strategy, you played yourself.
But that works two ways. The most important thing is to realize that the problem is on the board, it’s not with you. I ask people what piece they are on the chessboard. And some people say “I’m the king” or “I’m the knight.” And then they ask me what piece I am, and I say, “I’m no piece. I take the position of God.” Even if the king gets checkmated it doesn’t stop me. It’s the king that got checkmated, not me. You could call it a Zen approach to chess. And it also works in life.
I’m an American and I’m very patriotic when it comes to chess. I’d rather imitate Bobby Fischer than imitate Garry Kasparov. Fischer’s way of thinking was more aggressive. They found out years later by using computers to analyze his games that he should have lost some of the games he won, but he was determined not to lose. Every time they had him in a so-called losing position, his will and determination would make him win. It was something besides pure mathematical insight, statistics, probability, and strategy. There was some spark in Fischer, his obsession to win, that helped him triumph. 
I think most of my approach to life has been like that, to find order in chaos, to be in the middle of a bunch of things happening at the same time, but find focus. I strive to be like the sun sitting in the middle of the solar system with all the planets spinning around it — millions of things going on. It’s just sitting there being the sun, but exerting gravitational effect on everything. I think man should look at himself that way. Similarly to the sun or to the nucleus of an atom, and all the confusing things going on around him are okay as long as he’s staying focused on what he’s doing as long as he’s being himself.
Bobby Fischer lost when he became the pieces. When  he'd lose he’d go to his room and cry; he really took things hard. He couldn’t separate what happened on the board from what happened to himself. And some people think that it drove him crazy. I don’t think he was crazy. I think he was eccentric. But I think he lost a crucial part of perspective that you need in the game and in life.
In the end, the best strategy, the best tactic you can have in chess is the same one you should use in life: Never give up. Never let them count you out. That’s how the greats play, right down to the last move. That’s one more i reason why chess is like a sword fight. It’s to the death. You should play it that way, like you should live your life, as a game with mortal stakes. A game you play right down to the last move.
