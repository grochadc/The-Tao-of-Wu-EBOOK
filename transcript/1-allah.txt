All Praise due to Allah, Lord of all the Worlds.
Supreme Peace and Blessing. This Book of Wisdom is Volume Two of the Wu-Tang Manual and a second installment to the chambers of ideas of the Wu-Tang as told by the Abbot.
In the Divine Mathematics, Knowledge is 1: the foundation of all things. Wisdom is 2: the manifestation of Knowledge. It is knowledge in action. Manifestation = Man Fest = Speak Action is action.
Wisdom is the separation that begins life. It is the explosion that created the universe. It is the division of every cell that multiplies to form a single life. It is the partition God renders when he says, “Let there be Light ” — separating light from dark, sky from ocean. It is the detachment of man from his rib to create woman.
Wisdom is woman. It is the womb one must pass through to become mentally born. Knowledge and Wisdom give birth to Understanding just as man and woman give birth to a child.
Wisdom is the word. It is the way to make Knowledge known. “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the word became flesh.” God's Knowledge was made manifest through words to create life.
Wisdom is reflection in time. Knowledge is static and timeless. It is the moment before the Big Bang , the explosion brings and boms Understanding through the fourth dimension, which is time.
Wisdom is water. It is the flood that drowned the wicked in the time of Noah. It is the sea that drowned the Pharaoh’s army when Moses used it to part the waters. It is the universal solvent into which all things dissolve in time.
