<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">TRAVELS</h3>

<p class="calibre1">The journey of a thousand milesbegins with a single step.</p>
<p class="calibre1">— Lao-tzu</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you live in the projects, you don’t leave them much. Everything is right there: laundry, grocery store,check-cashing place — all set up so you can live yourwhole life in a four-block radius. I’ve lived in at least tendifferent projects in New York — Van Dyke in Brownsville, Marcus Garvey in East New York, Park Hill andStapleton in Staten Island — and they all taught me somelliing, even if they were lessons no one would choose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine you’re eight years old, going to the store with111 i rt y-five cents to buy a pack of Now and Laters and a bagof sunflower seeds. You get there, three teenagers choke you with an umbrella, take your thirtyfive cents, and buycigarettes. That’s the projects-math and economics classon every block. Imagine you live with eighteen relativesm a two-bedroom apartment across the street from thecourthouse and county jail. You wonder why the jail andcourthouse are so dose to the projects; when you getlocked up there a few years later, you learn. You learn civics, government, law, and science every day— especiallyscience. Because the projects, like jail, is a science project.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One no one expects you to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I did leave— moved out of Stapleton projects at twentythree, m 1992— and not long after that, my brothers inthe Wu-Tang Clan and I became citizens of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But those project lessons are still with all of us, one of thefoundations for wisdom. They’re the darkness that lets ussee light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll give you an example.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1978, my mother, who worked in a numbers house,hit the number for about four g’s-enough money tomove eight of us into a three-bedroom place on DumontAvenue. This was in Marcus Garvey, a violent ghetto, butfor a minute there we felt like the white kids on the TVshow Eight Is Enough: eight kids with toys, bikes, and anew home. But before we could move in, the place wasrobbed. All our stuff— toys, bikes, ftirniture— was gone,right before Christmas. We were heartbroken but movedin anyway, and before long I got to know our next-doorneighbor, Chili-Wop.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chili-Wop was the coolest motherfucker you’d evermeet. He was a drug dealer with muscles, gold chains,mad style, and a crazy way of talking. “Whasuuup!” he’dyell. “It’s Chili-Waaawp, nigga, whaaaat!” For some ream in, Chili-Wop took a liking to me. He started taking meon trips — drug runs, really, although I didn’t know it atthe time — and began looking out for me. Chili-Wop became an ally, a protector in a violent world. Finally, afterI VI lived there for nearly two years, he told me something.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“When y’all first moved in, I robbed your house, maaan.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I never knew you was gonna be a cool family.” When heI old me, there wasn’t much I could do about it, and bythen he was like my best friend — or as they say in thehood nowadays, my big homie — so in a way it was cool.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s just one hood lesson; Your allies can arrive asenemies, blessings as a curse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I was ten, Chili-Wop was sixteen. By the time Iwas eleven, Chili-Wop’s crew was shot up by rival drugdealers, and he ended up in jail. That was life on DumontAvenue, which I now see for what it was: hell — a hell ofviolence, addiction, misery, and humiliation. These forceswere in even the air and water; in times of heavy rain,human excrement floated by under our basement-levelbedroom, where me and my five brothers slept on twoI win beds. No one chooses to live like that, but I now seethat even that experience — living where shit floats — wasa source of precious wisdom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s like a story from the life of Da’Mo, the Indian monk who brought Zen Buddhism to China. One day, Da’Mowas talking with another monk, who began to denouncemud— saying how dirty it was, how a man should stayclean, keep away from mud. But Da’Mo observed that thelotus grows on mud: “How can you defame mud whensuch a beautiful flower grows from it?” he asked. Da’Mo’steachings reached everywhere— from the samurai class ofJapan to the kung fti monks of Shaolin to the housingprojects of Staten Island. I apply Da’Mo’s wisdom to theprojects. I believe the misery there brought forth a certainflower that wouldn’t have grown anywhere else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was thirteen years old when I saw the kung-fu film7 he Thirty-sixth Chamber of Shaolin , the story of a manwho trains to be a Shaolin monk then leaves the templeto teach the world their style of kung fu. Nine years laterI formed the Wu-Tang Clan-and we left Staten Islandto teach the world our style of hip-hop. Eight years afterthat, I came to the original Shaolin, saw the real Wu-TangMountain— and saw that it was all part of one whole. Isaw that we really were what we’d always claimed to bemen of Wu-Tang.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaolin is about as far from Staten Island as you canget. It’s on Mount Song, the center peak of Taoism’s FiveGreat Mountains in China, a sacred place, high above thebanks of the Yellow River. There on the mountain’s western edge stands the Shaolin temple: low and sturdy, redwalls and round windows, the same courtyard where monks have practiced kung fu ever since Da’Mo visitedIn I lie sixth century.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaolin is seven thousand miles from New York City.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wil Tang Mountain is even farther. Five thousand feetabove sea level, a five-hour bus ride through windingmountain roads, and a home to Taoist monasteries goinghut It fifteen hundred years. But when we stood on thismountain and looked up at the range of peaks called thet fine Dragons, this is what we saw: three mountains1 1 inning a giant W — the symbol I chose to represent a• lew of nine men, nine years earlier. It was as plain as■ lily, and has been for a million years. But some thingsiiieii’t visible until you’re truly ready to see them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I stood there with Shi Yan Ming, a man I call Sifu,which means “teacher.” He’s a thirty-fourth-generation Mniolin monk who defected to the United States the ‘Mime year we formed Wu-Tang. As we looked over the mountains, Sifu and I talked about the original Wuliiug — how it was founded by a monk named ZhangNiilll’cng, who had been banished to this mountain for sing violence and doing wrong. Zhang Sanfengcame lo I lie mountain to meditate and find God and eventually founded the Wu-Tang. Our crew had lots of meanings for the words Wu-Tang — “Witty, Unpredictablehi lent and Natural Game,” “We Usually Take Another 5Nlgga’s Garments” — in China, I learned another, the ^i a iginal one: “Man who is deserving of God.” So in that sense, we are all Wu-Tang. You are WuTang. If you ever stood on a mountain or by an oceanand felt a deep connection, a vast infinite presence insideyou, you felt it: what Taoists call Oneness, Muslims callAllah, others call God. That’s what I felt on Wu-TangMountain, but it’s also what I felt in Staten Island andeven Dumont Avenue in Brooklyn — only dimmer, quieter. Allah’s truth is within us all, all the time — a seedwaiting for light to help it grow. Wisdom is the Light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a book of Wisdom — an accumulation ofsongs, parables, meditations, and experiences to helpmanifest that truth in your life. Wisdom is what showsthose in darkness the Light, what reveals the path or theWay. It’s what we all need to live. The sutras of the Buddha teach that without wisdom there is no gain. In theBible’s Book of Proverbs, King Solomon chooses wisdomover all the other gifts that God offers him — long life,riches, fame — but through wisdom achieved these giftsand many more, including seven hundred wives. InIslam’s Divine Mathematics, we learn that Wisdom isthe Two after One, which is Knowledge — it is proofof knowledge, reflection of knowledge, knowledge in action. In my life, all these understandings of wisdom haveproven true.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Krishna said that you can study all day, pray all day,chant all day, but you’ll get to Heaven faster if you hangwith wise men. I’ve been blessed by wise men my wholelife — whether it was my cousin GZA, who first taught me Mathematics, my Chinese brother Sifu, who teachesme kung fu, or the philosophy students I met in Athens,the villagers I shared mud huts with in Africa, the audioinventors I worked with in Switzerland, the film directorsin Hollywood, the mullahs of Egypt. The kind of artistthat I am, I tend to meet people who want to show mesomething, and I’m always down to learn. In the WuTang Clan, I’m known as the Abbot — which, like Sifu,means “teacher” — but a real teacher is also a student,someone who never stops learning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Book of Proverbs says that King Solomon soughtwisdom from the cradle to the grave. That’s a way of saying he sought rebirth. Just as you must come through awoman’s womb to attain physical birth, so must youc ome through Wisdom to achieve mental birth. And likec hildbirth, Wisdom often comes with pain. Pain, joy,fear — all have borne in me wisdom, which, like water, is.in ever flowing spring from a bottomless ocean, a flowof life that takes the shape of any vessel, that reveals itselfin all bodies and all moments. For Wisdom is the Way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve been given the chance to hear the true andliving</p>
<p class="calibre1">So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">-R 7 .A, “A Day to God Is 1,000 Years”</p>

<p class="calibre1">- — RZA, “N.Y.C. Everything”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let the caller and the called disappear;be lost in the call.</p>
<p class="calibre1"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In every story and life, there’s a call. In the Book of Exodus, it comes to Moses after he leaves Egypt as a•lii’pherd: One of his sheep gets away, he goes lookingl”i it on a mountain, and he hears a voice — God calling!i i him. In the Koran, it comes to Muhammad after he’sli.nl kids and has lived a full, righteous life: He’s fortyi mis old and meditating in a cave, and he hears a voice — Allah calling him to be a prophet. Or look at San Te, in the film Thirty-sixth Chamber: He’s out in the countryside rebelling against the Manchu government and sees a dude break a box of fish open with his bare hands. He asks him, “How’d you do that?’ and the guy says, “It’s kung fu; I learned it at Shaolin.” That one word, Shaolin, was a call to San Te — what sent him to seek knowledge, become a monk, and spread the wisdom of kung fu around the world. I believe the call can come to anyone, at any time. I know because it came to me, one night in a Staten Island housing project, in July of 1976.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was bom Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to one of the biggest families in New York. My mother had eleven kids, so she’s responsible for thirtyfive, forty people. My great-uncle had eight children — one of whom would become OF Dirty Bastard — so that sprouted another forty, fifty people, and it goes on from there. Through marriage and bloodline, we spread across all five boroughs. Part of the reason is we were scattered from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My family broke up when I was three years old. In my last memory of my father, he’s holding me in one hand and a hammer in the other, smashing up the furniture.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since my mother couldn’t afford to raise the five of us herself, she sent us away, and I went off to live with her father’s family in North Carolina. That’s where I got to know my uncle Hollis, the first wise man in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">    ! lollis had that Solomon kind of wisdom. He was a doctor, a wealthy man with hundreds of acres of land, many adopted children, and a joy of life that followed him everywhere. He was the kind of man you’d have to i nil enlightened. Every one of my mom’s brothers and “islets had a different father, and her father’s family didn’t like my grandmother, who had my moms when ‘■In’ was sixteen. But Hollis had love for his brother’s daughter. He was always checking up on her, trying to I ml her in school — although she never went, and just kept having kids instead. But Hollis had a compulsion to lake care of these kids, especially me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as I got down to North Carolina, Hollis started le.K hing me things, setting aside books for me to read, •“lying, “Bobby, I want you to study.” Before I turned four, I was doing my older brother’s homework. From Hollis I learned about science and religion, but also poetry and »| &gt;oken word. One of the first books he gave me was a colin I ion of Mother Goose rhymes — which I started memoi wing immediately — and he was always going around • lying these strange verses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never cry when a hearse goes by,” he’d say. “Because you may be the next to die. They’ll cover you with a cold white sheet. They’ll put you down about six feet deep. It’s not so bad the first few weeks, until you start to mumble mid creep, and the worms crawl in and the worms crawl “ill. mid the ants play pinochle on your snout, your ulomach turns the sickest green as pus runs out like thick 11 12</p>
<p class="calibre1">whipped cream …” It was an old Southern folk rhyme — one of many Hollis used to say — and before long I started saying it myself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollis also took us to church every Sunday. It was an old Southern Baptist church where the services bugged me out. I loved the Bible stories I was reading, but I didn’t like this room where people were falling out, catching the Holy Ghost, slobbering all over the place. That happened in a lot of black churches, and I could immediately see it was phony. The screaming and moaning just didn’t feel right. The spirit of God sounded beautiful to me, but I quickly separated the experience of God from church. I just couldn’t see God in the fake-ass preachers or people wallowing on the ground. But I could see him in Hollis, my first real teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, when I was seven, my mother called us back to New York. Eight of us moved in with her at Marcus Garvey projects in Brooklyn. There, a different kind of education began.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our place was on Dumont Avenue, right across the street from Betsy Head Pool — a vicious, violent place, the kind you definitely weren’t coming back from with your sneakers. Kids from Brownsville projects, Tilden projects, Van Dyke projects, and Marcus Garvey used to hang out there, and two guys named Bighead Mike hung at the basketball court next door. One was Mike Tyson, the other was a drug dealer who later shot up our stoop trying to get a rival dealer (who happened to be my friend Chili Wop).</p>
<p class="calibre1"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">My second night living there, I got jacked at the store by 1 1 1 1 re Icenagers. When I got home, my mother asked me i ll . 1 1 happened. When I told her, she grabbed me and a Imli Iter’s knife and, still in her nightgown, walked me I &gt;,u k lo the store, looking for these motherfuckers. That Wim when I got a sense of the family with me now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hut the fact is, at this point I was a nerd: deep into I ii ii iks, saying “Yes, sir, no, ma’am,” going to church every Sunday. 1 may have been staying in the hood, but I was living in my head. That changed in the summer of 1976.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something was happening in New York that year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I here was a force in the air that didn’t have a name yet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ami this one afternoon, it was alive at a block party in the I’ ll l&lt; I till projects in Staten Island. I had come by to visit it i v i ousin Gary, who would become the GZA.There.beI wren the two buildings where kids played stickball, some I if. had plugged their systems into the lights. I remember Will king in, hearing the sound, feeling the energy, and getimp, sucked in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was DJ Jones, and the MCs were MC Punch and ‘ fiilncy. They were on the mike saying just a couple of Vary simple rhymes, the same two or three lines all night long. That was rap way back then — just one or two phiiiscs repeated. Like a mantra. And when I heard that In .it and those rhymes, I felt a euphoria I can’t even expl.nn I ended up staying there through the night, not y . 1 1 1 n g hack to the house until eleven o’clock and getting .u| tins whupping from my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because in that parking lot, I heard the love of my life 14 calling to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The night was cooling off; I was dancing with a girl — me just eight years old and doing the wop, grinding up on her, freaking her. Then I heard one of those MCs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Back then, songs were sung. Instruments were played.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the voice of a man speaking words over music.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It soimds crazy now — I’ve written thousands and thousands of lyrics since then, even lyrics jumping off Hollis’s folk rhymes with the group Gravediggaz, on an album called Six Feet Deep. But that night, these were the first words I heard spoken over a beat. It’s like it says in the Gospel of John: “In the beginning was the Word.” And to me, those words weren’t just rap lyrics. They spoke to something inherent in me. If you ask my older brother, he’ll tell you I was reading Dr. Seuss in rhyme and rhythm at age three. But up until that night, I’d been living in my head. These words and this music, they were a call — a call to something deep inside me. They were a call to my soul.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it came in a simple party rap, a few lines that went on through the night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dip-dip, dive So-so-cialize Clean out your ears Open your eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">Open your mind, body, and soul to God’s voice in whatever vessel that bears it. Let it pull you into the world.</p>
