<h2>FEAR</h2>
<p>I was afraid as a child. I was afraid of everything. I was scared of water — I couldn’t swim — I was scared of trucks on the turnpike, and mostly I was scared of ghosts. But at some point, I realized something. A ghost is something you create yourself — a man’s mind makes it happen. If there were nobody on Earth, would a ghost still have a chance to spook somebody? No. You manifest ghosts through fear. </p>
<p>The words of Marcus Garvey resonated with me. He said, “Fear is a state of nervousness only fit for children. Men should not fear. The only thing man should fear is God. To fear anything other than God is to offend God.” I carry that to this day: Enlightened men do not fear.</p>
